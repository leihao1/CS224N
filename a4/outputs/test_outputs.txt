You know what I do is write for the kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids -- more read in the United States.
And I always tell the people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or <unk> <unk> and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is usually something that fell somewhere in the place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleed every week on the bathroom of the kids, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when she saved my life in the house of the teachers.
He did it <unk>
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, at half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> he said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults, we never get to know us.
You could get it to Ohio and please bring that man who I know you already found.
And I must tell you I've got pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stand with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, from his family, because I was necessary, by it.
It's something we knew what to do.
And so as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and went on in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around the <unk> of the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't even think it was a <unk> on another <unk> of snow after year.
They are <unk> when they fall out of glaciers or you break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to <unk> and they hang on to the end, while others can't afford the more and a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated <unk> and they, as much as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts a <unk> I'm breathing his atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg, the iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up with me to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments there are just that way and will not have that way again.
It's not the death when they <unk> it is not an end, but a continuation of their way through their way of life.
Part of the ice in the <unk> I photograph is very <unk> it has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I would like to show you is from an iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's unlikely to actually be able to witness an <unk>
Here it is.
You can see on the left one little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship moved toward the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk>
It's about about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so the iceberg -- the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979 the same day, exactly at the same time, every single one -- a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to stand too much in the details of conception, because if they stop thinking about the conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine in one case, the sperm and the sperm is joined the X <unk>
And in the other case, the <unk> chromosome is joined the X <unk>
Both of them <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my ground ground in my ground in the ground for two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way people are going to make the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies -- to say, human bodies have been considered body body -- the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that I work in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are doctors.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins -- two people inside the same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people far lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex with <unk> individuals whose physics of the physics is not fits into male relations.
And in general lines, we can see it <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to put in some examples in ways of having a sex that doesn't fall into the ordinary forms of male or <unk>
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene <unk> and it tells you to the <unk> that we all have in the life that we all have in the life that we have to become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testes will produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a result, the body is developing in a course typically <unk>
When I was <unk> the baby is about a little girl.
It's a child. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual time, when someone realizes that something is going on.
And after doing tests you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has <unk> and a y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like this.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who doesn't know his structure <unk> I believe being a typical woman most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> that has the Yentl syndrome to the <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in a certain form of <unk>
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a <unk> year-old guy born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, I was wearing a life as a boy and just found out that he had <unk> and womb.
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that, in essentially creating a male hormone environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19 when he started having the medical problems for the internal <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> and they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk>
We don't know what that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies do that be <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> to surgery -- it's not to be able to have a better physical health better.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get to a number of surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an African identity is to have an African anatomy of African anatomy in the historic terms.
A ruthlessly simplistic.
And when you have a body that shows you something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very supportive ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
Imagine the amazing thing that you have children that are born like two people inside the same body.
The highest recent case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
Many journalists called them to wonder, "What do you exam to do to determine if <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there aren't such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> and <unk> are us who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought of these were <unk> categories that will be <unk> directly with <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It also in terms of race, something that turns out much more complicated than the terminology of it.
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What would you do from the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we look at the science of science, we get more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that <unk> are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question if someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved still not <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put it into another body.
And as a result, we have to address a dilemma of determining the death of somebody -- and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simplest categories of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
I'm a liberal, I'm a liberal, and I'm a liberal, to the people with <unk> bodies but I have to admit that I got nervous.
And so that these categories are much more fragile than what we thought was <unk>
It comes from the point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent fan of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical and so radical in what they did, that I found every bit of seeing that piece of music, which is <unk> and not for the music, which is totally <unk>
This is what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
The brother <unk> were to me, the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another one that was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as you all remember, what we did -- what our father did, the <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world monarchs didn't know about DNA, but they had clear the idea of the birth of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that they got the political power for the right of blood passed from the grandfather into the father and then the son, and so on.
And I realized, I was rejected by that idea, and I replaced it by a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game game and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, and that was a very radical thing.
And partly they were doing it because they become part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the story of the Parents -- that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations -- and therefore we understood the concept of power that would be passed away from a kind of vague idea of birth.
They were moving toward a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think about it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And the <unk> women.
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of Civil Rights movement by saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color who have <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking for why we keep them <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't mean that we should be able to give up the anatomy.
I don't mean that at five years they had to be allowed to have sexual relationships or married.
There's some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they keep it and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things: <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Through the contrary, was born in term: was born October 1 from 1980.
For the only fact I was born three months before Mary is attributed to all the rights three months before Mary -- the right to sexual consent, the right to the vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that, not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
And Henry, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I don't tell you if it is <unk> by virtue of being considered a man right now is <unk> by <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Everywhere on your hand, does not have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science goes so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to tell that a democracy built on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time I feel like science is given us.
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught up in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have a chromosome. And to marry a woman you have to have the y chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't do tests that are given to people.
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, on his speech, "I would love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people who are <unk> not in their skin, but on the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea seems like good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I know some of the <unk> <unk> that they probably deserve more social services that some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can be able to make more intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sexual relations that people like 40 to know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an MRI -- maybe with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense for democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian when a man who feels attracted to the other men is <unk> unless you're willing to have a change of sex, in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon who talked about a couple of years ago that had done a couple of years ago that had done a few years ago that I had done to light fraternal twins to then pick them down and then pick them down and then <unk> their fame.
But when I asked the phone -- I asked the name of the operation, it was a very <unk> operation, responded to me that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
I said, "Well, has been the political asylum. Instead of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who they are without <unk> to change the same time.
So I think we need to be the head.
Well, to finish -- I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a bit radical for a feminist, and it is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about group.
Since years, because I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in sexual differences.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to get care of those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers that I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought I was <unk> like <unk> made me a <unk>
Tell me, what is <unk> the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've heard.
Feminism is got to get rid of the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I think about your question, the more I think about your question, the more it has something <unk> in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something on average, something else between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the symptoms were very attentive to figure out how to protect the people in the state, we may be able to get the <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the support of <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we think about democracy beyond the <unk> thinking less about the individual body in terms of identity, and thinking about relationships.
So while we try to create a more perfect change, think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the possibility of choice between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, right now, we are far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their construction cost.
So we could easily put it into the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But we just replaced it by apartments.
So imagine that half of the people who wanted to live in apartments already became owners, and then the other half is still missing to do that.
You could try to increase the ability to make expansion of all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we think about is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid all the ones and causes them.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, building a totally new, new apartment building always and when the rules of that place would rise the construction instead of putting it into <unk>
So I proposed that the governments are going to build new reform zones to hold cities and gave them a name: cities under <unk>
I was later late at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 percent of us will come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
And in the following presidential elections, you know, <unk> <unk> a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked him to <unk> it was his chief <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, such as those rules that tell you that you can't go and pick all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes a lot of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent to <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They told me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, we got a hotel room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York City <unk> which, in some cases, it's worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, which is a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going on there and an option for people to choose if they want to go to live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, that's important, this could be the way for our country to go forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and five of the January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which included a picture like this, which was trying to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square kilometers.
So I was trying to convince them that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed the <unk>
And this explained to you that a new city can deliver new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that you could go in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away into the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government, they would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that would help them establish and make the <unk> rules so that they could all be able to rely on that <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and we saw one place.
This photo is from there.
It could easily run a thousand square miles.
And soon after the 19th of January, the 19th of January, voted in the Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional layout that would allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis, the voting in the favor of this constitutional <unk> was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 21, they passed over again in another voting voting on one voting on it.
Immediately after the voting of the 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> <unk> about 30 <unk> was the two places in the world that are most interested in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new New York center in the city that is building in North Korea than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about it <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to go and allow them to operate under an external legal system.
A country has committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last sentence for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders, which are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing that we know that they've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of businesses that wanted to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would immediately go to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a work -- sometimes they are mothers who have to earn money to just eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who have not seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like in building a new city in <unk>
Or do we build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What do you think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends were asked to say, "Thank you TED <unk>
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a <unk> and it's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, photograph and post on my blog suits and colorful <unk> and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk> stores.
Ah, thank you.
<unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I go to meet people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My point is <unk> and buy it into my personal search for <unk>
So what am I going to find today?
It will be from my size?
I'm going to like the color color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I have won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what do you bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I brought seven pairs of clothes, and there was nothing else.
So inside a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in <unk> and that means that I found a few things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound that interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this journey of not using new clothing.
Let's start on Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see good.
You almost always see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the whole, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be wrong -- when you're wearing a <unk> red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just care about you, you will be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that carry inside.
Sometimes people tell me that I play the <unk> or I remind you at their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do good with something, it's almost certain you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside and not look at you that you can't afford it.
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal truth six words for you: The gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal style and only is a great way to tell the world something about you without saying a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people were approaching this week just because of what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to get emotionally emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there will always be another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and I go.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who's totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some of these <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need a lot of logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves to play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that may have developed over the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can only be in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
And I remember looking at a child playing in a parking bar in a parking seat.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet the playing play with that parking lot of parking lot he taught a valuable lesson, and it is that the big things don't allow them to be able to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you are a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with holes in parking spaces, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things -- like you can go through walls, or that may be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point was the physics of the physics -- a few years ago; you needed quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need you to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit very well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the small particles still follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so I should not keep all the principles of mechanical mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't have been.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a major quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to make it a little bit. It's just right at the center.
And then here we do a good good approach to the little baby <unk>
What we see is a little bit of the metal, a way of springboard and <unk> <unk> on a platform.
And so I did that almost the same way you could a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
And for the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in the form of swimming <unk> which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum element, but it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know what it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all sorts of weird things, but then when other people go up to get out of doing those things, because I don't want them to get them, or actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not only people, it's the light that <unk> it and the wind of the room and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to drive all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
And we put the lights up, then they <unk> a <unk> and pulled out the air, and then it turns it into a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when being only in the <unk> the little bit of metal is free to act like he want.
So we measure their motions.
We found that it moved in very strange forms.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way it was <unk> was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft motivation, we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't take it to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing -- and we didn't get it at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all of the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just rather <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> the <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one atom only atom and that little metal is about the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece may be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my sort of logic that's talking about.
So imagine if they were in a number of places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we get it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a little space.
You hear a lot about the fact that quantum mechanics says everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not quite true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define the one who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my chief which is here and that allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months and so.
A lot of negotiations and stories, you get it back with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- I didn't care about it, but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go in museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Better than it shows the demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the <unk> gallery -- the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to get into one of my favorites, to the <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the top plane, and, with one click, we jump inside.
You're inside that you want to go to the end of the hall,
Come forward. What are you going to go?
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign there.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images that we've captured what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask, "What do you get to 10,000 billion <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10 billion pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to be <unk>
So I started play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems <unk>
And I went back and discovered that kids were actually playing something.
And I talked to a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further into and see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the picture, so you'll see what there is.
This is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is for coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump again at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The <unk>
The example I showed was to find out detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really the <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I had never seen it so before.
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that's the same.
You can online to create his own museum -- to create your own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, you walk in, I've created this function that I call <unk> power -- we just made a zooming around it.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can <unk> you send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel like looking at these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I believe that for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital middle does justice to their artwork and it's represented properly online.
And the great question that they do today is, "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon everybody.
I've got something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel today.
In our lab, we call it sensitive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian, <unk> all the kids in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that has happened very interesting in the <unk> racing over the last two decades.
So some time ago, if you wanted to earn a career of Formula 1, took a budget and put it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, it's <unk> real-time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today, what's interesting is that real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond very differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As I note aside I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crusts on the planet, but it is 50 percent of the population of the population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and even 80 percent of the CO2.
If we could do something with cities, it would be something big.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition from <unk> <unk> for the end of the year at MoMA, during the summer time.
It's called <unk> Uncle <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start to <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all existing atoms -- they were <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In a sense it's almost like <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end he took the hammer out, and he threw it out of Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> and what didn't you say?
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just about <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup Cup in the World.
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy and France, and at the end of the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the play.
The time line is on the top.
On the early late afternoon, there are people here and there are people here doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people do a fast call and they go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
They raised Italy, Yes!
That night everyone went to <unk>
There you see the big summit there.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister of then.
And then the whole world <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from the time <unk> people will <unk> is a great party, and you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have done just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and consume.
Today, we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things go.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift over the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year, to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that were all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage and then started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist.
They're going on complicated things and there is a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we stopped at it is still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle we <unk> a day still stays there.
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change from behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is to push the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe has a beautiful tradition of the use of the water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology do technology, the new technology, to put together to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> which is open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with water.
If you fall to the pixels you can write in them, to show patterns, images texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen in the image.
And we presented this to Mayor <unk>
It liked a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors no windows, but when you are approaching it it opens so you can see you.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all of the architecture went on, as in this case.
Those days, there will always be somebody, in the winter, when you go down the roof, somebody who was there and said, <unk> <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is working.
You see the <unk> people around the inside.
And here I am myself trying not to <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that was still making slices and holes in water and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water and the projections of them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and every one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with other in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud,
This is a flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what changes is the light, not the position of the pixels.
You can play with a different guy.
So imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then the whole thing could be a 3D pixels in 3D the one that you can get near and forth and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of the people, and so on, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best television dancers of today, the star of the New York City <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left side, you see the <unk> capture it in different <unk>
It's both like 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can push all the movement.
You can walk around the way.
And once we have the pixels -- we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input to <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine it again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time, and the Obama campaign is, we can move from the digital world of the digital world, the power of the <unk> to the physical world.
In our case, this may be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it may be to deal with the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how will happen from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people work in doing this together, <unk>
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And these particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with the pixel from the pixel from the pixel from the pixel anyway.
You can move through the inside, have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the London Olympics.
So that's a physical cloud of the sky like something you can go up, like a new peak of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in their genes -- they could improve the <unk> by a more accurate way, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in better ways, to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do you think about creativity?
Hands up. Let me see.
<unk> was probably supposed to be the number of creative people today.
That's very good.
How many would they choose <unk>
A few more more.
And the <unk>
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of you, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe be possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference but today, I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great commander of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing -- it makes sense of the light of <unk>
But if you actually embrace biological evolution consider this: It's just the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or to us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right on one end, is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here a few years ago.
It might seem to be far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in their most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin which is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it is the same protein, with chemically <unk> from which it comes from the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the intestine more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> does this thing about <unk> you think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully competent environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, wet, <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that can want to have no effort for their own.
It really is like a quick pathway for bacteria with occasional disruption of some hasten <unk> into the output.
But by so forth, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we affect the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become a different thing, something like <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, the life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and unique <unk> and human life, a little bit of a grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I fell in love with something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the organisms, every cell just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted into the two daughters cells.
But when organisms exhibit the organisms, things start to change.
It goes into the <unk>
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the death of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death by <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her hotel door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a gorgeous <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
It's <unk> says George, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily only only different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to get me healthy.
I wanted to regain health in disease.
I wanted to live more and more a healthier way.
Evolution consists of moving the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> <unk> designed to send the genetic load into the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I believe that all of us will <unk> the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to tell you <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily apply to longevity.
They don't necessarily apply to the largest or the faster or the faster and even the more clever.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish cut it into <unk> yet they've managed to do that a surgical environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look ahead, at the <unk> phase -- I would say there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning is that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and written from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be able to fit ourselves as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it is not possible to have the amount of isolation that evolution happen.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the traditional type, natural, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here would say that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> as a <unk> planets are going to exist, and the environmental changes that can produce natural evolution there.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing possibility, intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and chosen for us as individuals in the decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we come to do this?
First, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what it takes on the individual and family level.
Think about it as well as possible to be able to choose not only sex with your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic settings to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to get rid of diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and he was 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
When I was finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion bases in the human genome at a cost near 20,000 and a week.
Not very much for the fact that the human genome will actually be done, and it will be more and more at the reach of all.
They come from those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin cells in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us, but they're going to engage other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course, with the vaccine against flu -- in cells in a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something nice that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just another two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies but if they could change the cells from their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn <unk> and give her children a better chance of a healthy life, remove the diabetes, to remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who don't want the more <unk>
And then, that same analytical <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also take a lot of disease to prevent ourselves to a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could be able to deal with the next generation of the vending machine.
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live more time?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions of sending this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have to turn the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that might normally take 100,000 years and we can take it down to 1,000 years and maybe in the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or we're going to selectively selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us but not to the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deepest thing about everything, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For worse, and for worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
So they immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already broken the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
And the pilot <unk> the Hudson River.
And that's not the way that is not the road.
It <unk> the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and not <unk>
And then three words said ...
The top three words that I think was heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. It was <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in an instant.
We have this list of things to do before they died, these things we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in and didn't do it, all the fences who wanted to repair all the experiences I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that, later on, I was a phrase, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll open it up.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that thing has really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while we <unk> the bridge George Washington, which wasn't very much -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also to my ego.
And I'm sorry the time that we get in things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, like <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
Within two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to have <unk> <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental watch is <unk> by 14, 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And while I went back, I had the feeling of, Whoa! I'll die not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love myself, I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in one thought, which is just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent --   And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And for me, that was the whole reason for the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, which is the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I was given a miracle, not to die that day.
And I was given another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You who are flying today, the challenge you can imagine that the same thing happens in your airplane -- and please not be that -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What do you think that they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are being the best parents that we want.
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of different projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> today has a total paralysis,
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation company, so obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the art world.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just I want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and he will be able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that he <unk> I saw Stephen <unk> not that all the people with paralysis can be able to communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be an important one -- you can't really do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, and they're making it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check, I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I got married with his brother and her father there at that very moment, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to get it back and make art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who have so much on your inner inside cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research that has a technology that enables you to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer you draw on that and record negative space.
So they go out there making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so I started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of the organization and a lot of the way to move things back to another one we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine so that they could <unk> it could be a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call him <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get a electronic email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is great!"
The other thing that we did was bringing seven programmers all over the world <unk> from every corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife and I, we moved to the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took the control over the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we were doing something completely stupid and when they <unk> they would have taken off the frames of the walls and their place would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we went down to the ducks <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
These are a pair of <unk> <unk> that we buy in the shipping space of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera -- we put it on a light light, and there's a device that's free -- that's free -- and it's building <unk> we published the code <unk> the software is down to free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There is no hospital you can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this photo because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a planning year, two weeks of programming programming intense sessions all last night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photo because this is the support system of your life and is looking through the support system of his life.
He <unk> the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the park park outside the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends, and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what said, "This was the first time I draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody finally came to <unk> and would pull me out of there so that I could be able to communicate.
It's not <unk>
In some form that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to walk with this.
It's a cool device -- but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So that's why we're trying to figure out how to do it and make it faster and <unk>
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is great!"
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, television magazine recognized us as one of the greatest inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about all of this -- and this is what ends up of closing the <unk> is that in April this year in the <unk> of <unk> at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it possible.
None of the things that there is in this room was possible -- the scenario, the <unk> the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something and I was fascinated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want everyone to do every day when we find something that we feel like to be done. If it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who is not me.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years -- in situations that are often very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> difficult areas.
And I spent 30 days eating only this -- sort of fun in the middle, very dangerous at the end of the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been asking me in situations in such awful situations with the only goal to be able to look at social issues, in ways that we can find interesting things, and hopefully analyzing that in a way that you see amusing and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit differently.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered the rights to the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was looking at was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and as a content that could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous for you or your company at all.
But saying this, it's a very good <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree of progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If they had asked me a year ago, I hadn't been able to do it for certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we tested the <unk> world of advertising.
And as I said earlier, I was in terrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could happen to me -- nothing could be made to something that hard or as dangerous as getting into the room with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film which is about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all film was <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The film is going to be called "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The greatest film, ever <unk> is that everything up at the bottom, from beginning to end, has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title of the title -- the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> in the film to <unk>
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it was more by <unk>
He was <unk>
But we are not only going to have the sponsors of the X brand in the title but we're going to make sure we use all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe you get a shoe -- and you get the most cool shoe you <unk>
The most great car that you've driven in "The greatest film, ever <unk> the best <unk> you have <unk> <unk> from "The greatest film, ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> MS: And so we <unk> the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That is the full idea, the whole shot of beginning to end.
And I would love you to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> But I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard the meeting with them, but certainly is going to be worth convincing a couple of big markings on it.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that film is going to look at us as a lot of <unk> idiots
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> on the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: It means you're not very optimistic.
So I was <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good. Image <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about the brands.
MS: Yeah. So that's the <unk> When you look at the people that you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where you go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: So I thought that <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation out the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to cause so many people to see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media scenario, is not the idea to tell that new vehicle worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
It was actually not such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like the <unk> <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> which is characterized by visibility or access to information, especially in the practices of <unk> being the last line, perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the president -- even the CEOs the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to it when it comes to how it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives rise to you, like that weird bear that still continues to <unk>
It's <unk>  Like this weird rural road.
And it's also very risky.
What else is <unk>
<unk> a <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want them to be <unk>
We want them to <unk> a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there is him looking at me as a <unk> saying, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and there's the history <unk>
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a company, wanting to help me -- and that's just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my own, I would have to take off the proxy and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to look back, and I started giving me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal issue.
MS: I have friends who make big, enormous, giant films and others that make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood movies say that the reason their films are so successful is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I am out there, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone can say "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little bit nervous.
I want you to help you with you."
Maybe you should have a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for a man like for <unk> to <unk> to <unk> on bar, or <unk>
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a little bit of <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
Let's get into the type of small movies that <unk> we are more good than a <unk>
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, <unk> people are the reason that this is why we're interested in.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you want in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you <unk>
How do we keep ourselves <unk> more time -- more <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common <unk>
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, the common <unk>
They have to talk to me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good <unk>
Woman: Let's bring the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something else -- <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray sensors and things like that.
Usually I'm wearing sunglasses, like sunglasses, or the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk>
Woman 2: At some sort of <unk> partly <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
They are <unk> toys to pets in the country and the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my <unk>
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failed.
Is that anything?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but often I was <unk> on the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If they were able to do it for them, you probably could do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell that world.
MS: So that world? I think your world is the world where you think about how people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from and they start in a place and you start in my case and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like the weird stuff -- I like the weird stuff.
A: Tell the <unk> for what does that be?
What is the <unk> What phase of <unk> you find is now?
Why is it important to you? What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> A: Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) Very good.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to go out of this.
There was a lot of crazy all over this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality personality -- the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox on them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong ones or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature to avoid the fear of the ones that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you are actually <unk> and you make yourself something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> marks and conscious marks -- those things that have gone and come up, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to get your computer identity, your brand, what would that be?
You're a <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you rather an <unk>
a little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> are like being playful to be playful as a cool <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> dominant, magic or mystic as <unk>
Or are you rather <unk>
Are you a sophisticated <unk> like <unk>
You're -- traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> stable, family family, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they have no control, they wouldn't have control over the end product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film, how now you use MRI to identify the <unk> centers in the brain both for commercial marketing as a film.
We went to San Paulo where the advertising advertising <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are becoming a way in schools with available problems in the United States.
The amazing thing to me is that projects where I've had the greatest answer or what I've had more success is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> taken out of their agencies, and they said, maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to do the people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it gone? They succeed?
Well, since the film was sent into the <unk> <unk> Let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This is just about a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> and press and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make lead.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies we talked about to their clients not being part.
I've always believed that if you take a risks, if you take risks that in those risks there is opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them into failure.
I think when you train your employees in the loss of <unk> it's preparing their entire company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to animate people who are not afraid of the opportunities that they can afford.
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear -- <unk> risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace risk.
And ultimately, we have to turn to transparency.
Now more than not a little bit of honesty is going to go through a long way.
And he said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good <unk> friends who were <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> is <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check to the name of the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my health care next year.
The idea behind the computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that controlled speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're completely different.
But if we managed to put an effective virus virus on a portable computer that was used by an engineer to set up this gray, and we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray box -- <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you about how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> part of the <unk> using multiple vulnerabilities of <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these empty boxes, these control systems.
And so that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had the environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they spent very strange.
<unk> were <unk> like a lab in the lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
It didn't make sense for me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
<unk> is actively looking at the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that place: is actually working on that place: is actually working on that place: is actually working on that place: is actually working on that place: is actually working on that place: is actually working on that place: is actually working on that
If it doesn't, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than you can do it soon.
And so we pulled out to the attack, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs and a small and a big.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed with people that obviously had all the internal information.
They would have all the points to attack.
You probably even know how much it <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you the load is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about about 15 lines of code.
It looks pretty much the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you about how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking for at the beginning, they were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to share it with the real world, with potential targets of the world.
We need theories about recipients we need to pass on or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
You don't find a number of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called it and I sat down in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find on code and data.
And it worked pretty good.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor it's that mobile phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly be <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> is <unk> in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they are <unk> what is called a <unk> and each <unk> contains <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it was better <unk>
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called incremental.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
And this gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
It wasn't like this.
The results have been that after several weeks of work.
They were going to take it on dead ends.
And yet, we discovered that both digital <unk> was given to one single goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We must not worry about the other goals that other goals are <unk>
I'm showing you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really got stuck.
That's the gray box and the top of you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input values and the infrared sensors and the vibration sensors and provide code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, this fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed by video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not be able to act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine goes down, you have to open away valves.
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> <unk> that spread this payload with a <unk> key -- like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms.
It was more possible.
And if you made that, with what you might have is a mass of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a large number of goals.
We must deal with the implications, better than we start to do now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been done in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My mind is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> Sea.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and give you <unk> skills, or another one that will make users just raise your hands and turn back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots <unk>
They're not different than something that gets in the morning, it gives you a great force, which is also increasing your speed, and help you for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected it to the universe and other things that are <unk>
This is not an amazing idea.
So to show you now what we're working on -- we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back to a <unk> <unk> and it's <unk> to take even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications and injuries in the back of the back in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage from my back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human Human
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give you 90 pounds per way for a lot of hours.
His flexible design, it allows you to put on <unk> <unk> and running <unk> movement.
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device -- this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back now to the users of chairs of the wheels, so I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 billion people about the wheels, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with often very young people with damage to the spinal cord that when their life is going to be at the 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is going older as an quickly <unk>
His only choice, many times -- by a brain injury, or some other twist -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been over the last 500 years, from their successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago in the neocortical column and as a result he couldn't walk up for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has some sensors ...
Not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board on the back.
There is some batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and they do it on the knees, and they make it move with this soft soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years on the top of my life when, by a stranger <unk> in the air, skiing it down the bottom of my life, skiing it down.
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement from <unk> down.
Shortly after, a doctor came into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You know, <unk> never <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole up to the last bit of hope for me.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs the bottom of <unk> climbing rocks and even riding <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not only of soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of chairs to all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos in rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with chimpanzees, their living relatives <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big guys, <unk> society Bonobos is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special, because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the mortal violence has not been <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> jungle, and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an invisible soil, and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also going to put the survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation will make you not fill in a stadium or a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the laughter hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes -- the <unk> the love, the love -- they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game game.
For us, and for them the game is fundamental to set bonds and foster <unk>
With it, we learn to <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors -- diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobos you see the roots that are very early from laughter, the dance and the human ritual is human.
The game is the glue that came together.
I don't know how you play with you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos in the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball, and I don't speak at football.
Here is a female and a young male male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> it has <unk>
Just that I think in this case, he loves it, right?
Yeah.
So sexual play is both common in bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because we put this video that really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female, who is playing with water <unk>
I think that like it, sometimes we play themselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the actual <unk> of creativity.
These are only tiny samples of the understanding that Bonobos are given us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to success to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's take the most of our ability to play.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate to play, you can be the moments that it's the most urgent thing.
So in primates, we will accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for the development of a for-profit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of captain in a fire <unk>
And in our city, where the volunteers are passionate about a highly skilled staff -- you have to get to the site of the fire very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career standing against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what was our task.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner of certainly <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end night, she was standing outside the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before I was -- <unk> <unk> <unk> came to the captain and he asked him to walk and save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> money who, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a fish building to save a live being just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and she brings this woman a pair of shoes."
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went on the stairs, at the end of the hallway went into the <unk> <unk> that at that height or less had ended up on the fire and came into the main room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my way back to the staircase where I met my <unk> and the beautiful dog in the front door.
I went from the house of the house to the house owner of the house where, as you would expect, his trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the <unk> owner of the brave effort proven to save her home.
The kindness that she watched on the other was someone else had had a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling on Robin <unk> as on my calling as a volunteer fireman -- I witness to <unk> acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of grace acts and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have made -- or are to be able to do remarkable levels of success, I would like to remind you about this.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have a little bit of to give it a little bit of <unk>
It was <unk> food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
They're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So you trained the <unk> breaking the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, you came back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a great fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were made in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to all the homes.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> stacked each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only to experts.
I don't personally think that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they come together through magnets.
So you can't be able to stand in the wrong way.
The bricks have a code of colors.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you only have to assemble a blue one, and you can very quickly start making higher circuits.
A blue one with a green one is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple play, they are really powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple gestures, very simple.
To make <unk> faster or more slow, <unk> just <unk> this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection of it.
We want all of the interactions in the world to get into brick brick to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given them to the children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to the touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics begin to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the School of Design School of Island, who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, and paper and paper and said, Make something <unk>
Here's an example of a project that have done, an canyon of <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> that has been afraid of the darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world where we live, this interactive world is us.
So let's go ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking for to engage with the environment focused on a focused lot.
collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> just for a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to get the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I was talking about time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, a initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, we asked them to work on government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like a <unk> of Peace <unk>
We took a few members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World -- we send them into the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with <unk>
Their task is to show you the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it comes up as if I would look at a date, but what you really look for is that somebody would clean it when you get caught up by the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get us to ask for help in this <unk> way.
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that time we spent a lot of last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You take <unk> when you look at it.
In doing so, you put him a name, in this case he threw him <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
So it has a uprising.
It's a modest app here.
Maybe it's the tiniest <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology in the Afghan government.
And it spreads <unk>
A responsible system of systems of <unk> when you see this app realized that he could use it -- not for the snow, but for citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people are <unk>
So that's why the citizens who <unk> them.
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to get people to get sick to clean sidewalks when they were.
So now we know about nine cities that will use using it.
And this has spread without <unk> in organic ways.
If you know a little government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
The software acquisition typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done by the normal channels that would have taken at least two years and next two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the court of California that up to the time about 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that comes in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral form, is a kind of shot from warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests to the best ways to work, not as in private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
It's also not like a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the government of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so they were building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to <unk> apps, every day in their own communities.
They haven't given up with the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line of the politics, the <unk> and all those other things that get us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone didn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, you would ask you, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was in choosing people to get them out of <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the heart of telephone and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He joined <unk> on the official knowledge.
I didn't find any. He started using animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put it very hard to see if it was <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk>
We didn't get that application.
It was the work of people in the New York Times Bureau of Boston.
One day, this is actually coming this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I make it <unk>
<unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so you all see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to the place, I found the trash cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet nights, <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to collaboration distributed violence.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
<unk> two people.
And it could have connected the government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper way than government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call control control, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
So a lot of people will get it, but think that one is the input of another.
Our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have we chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy in order to choose a new political leader and then we expect the government to destroy our values and we understand our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That is because government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
At the bottom is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> which keeps us from that that we funded as something that we currently operates on our against that other thing, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we'll have to make it sexy.
Because that's where the real government is happening.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They've been <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not activism as political activism is activism <unk>
And for the ones that we have taken care of the government, it's time for us to ask, what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they need to face.
Do you really believe that we will get to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't take government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand <unk> into civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and know that it's not so difficult to act differently, we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, <unk> I'm a greater generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're going to talk.
They can express their opinions at the same time and they do it.
So when they face the government problem they don't care about to hear their voices.
They're using their hands.
They're bringing hands into the work for programming applications that do better work for the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> pulling away from <unk> pulling a bucket of junk that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we always could have cleaned those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we are not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government and we get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they didn't get rid of the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it's about the important things that we have to do together, all together, we'll be a swarm of voices, or also we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is to me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons and prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED seeing and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here is impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have otherwise.
I say this because I believe identity is important important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I actually didn't learn this in the practice of the law, my work.
I learned that from my grandmother.
I grew up at a traditional house of a <unk> family by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it was power.
It was the last word in the family in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with <unk> <unk> the way we saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit like I looked at it, and I looked at it, and I would give me a good hug.
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would go back to <unk> and I was going back to me and said, "You know, you still feel my <unk>
And if I told him no, I gave it back to me again, and if I told him I know, I was left in peace.
It had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to get their time and their attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
At first I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at it and he <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I went through the room, and he took me out of the hand, and he said, "Come on, <unk> The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "That's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> who didn't <unk> I said, "Sure."
And then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> who are <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said to me, "Just want me to get me out three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that the <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> like that.
And then he said, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you are always going to do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> like that.
I grew up in the field, in Southern village, I have a brother a year older and a sister a year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I didn't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and I went to the forest.
And we just get the <unk> of all the <unk>
He took a drink of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same as we do.
I took something, your sister is also <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's wrong to take a <unk>
And he took my gaze on the strength and said, "Oh, not be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to tell you something before you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this will be <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this thinking that's a <unk> I mean by the power that has the identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others who really don't make any sense.
We can't get them to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother was naturally believing that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My guys died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There is 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities, or black or black, you find that much <unk> and so much despair.
One in three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Baltimore Baltimore, Washington -- all young people in color are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country, we have a court system that comes to you so much better if you're rich and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
<unk> policy and anger make us believe that these are not our problems with ours.
We are <unk>
It seems like interesting.
We're looking at our work with a few good developments good curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about rights for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be as high as it was before you <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where they sentence at 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for kids, without the possibility of coming back.
Right now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They would have people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense, you have to think that the final question is, people are people deserve to die by the <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> crimes but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by mistake.
Of each nine people who have been identified one that's innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A mistake, <unk> an innocent one of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation is not allowed to ever fly airplanes if in every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on the story, and I talk to you about slavery in the story.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was concerned to be <unk>
The terror threat was what they defined their lives.
Now there are more people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, and say, "Mr. Stevenson, of talks, and people who stop saying that in our history of deal with the first time with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "Hey, <unk> we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with <unk> and decades of political and <unk>
In this country we have an dynamic because we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we would love each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
We're hard to talk about <unk> I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that we could not overcome <unk> with no commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany who was <unk> on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's very disturbing to listen to what you want.
<unk> "Don't have death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room was quietly and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we can ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, intentional and <unk> we started to run people.
So let's think about this.
How would we be going to be in a world where a nation like Germany, let's start to people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We could not get it wrong.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these issues, the positive and wonderful things are, though, it <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, these realities are affected by the suffering, the abuse, the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
I've been talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more <unk> with the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that never come to TED.
If you think about them -- in a way, something that's within our own being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite the matter of being rational, so committed to the intellectual,
The innovation, the development is not just brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also because of the batteries of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just how brilliant and <unk> but also the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to truly be human, if we didn't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, the injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we do all of these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer who met Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, the lady <unk> I was called to me to go, <unk> comes the <unk>
You want to come and make it happen.
I was like, "Be lady. I know I do."
And so she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read him <unk>
And so I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And in one occasion, I was there listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks went to me and said, "Now, <unk> tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> and no freedom for the children.
We try to do something about the death row.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and at the end he looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out of <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> was <unk> I got my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst thing that we've ever heard.
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another one, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
It's not.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that although it's very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> -- very <unk> for our own technology, and our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they treat rich and powerful and <unk> but because of the form of the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I make too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a important way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I go to jail and I see my clients. I see 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so that they were given to them as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge to turn someone into what is not it?
The judge described as an adult, but I see a child.
One night a very late night was wake up <unk> by God, if the judge can become something you don't are, you must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 years old, a tiny, black <unk>
I started to work on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my black customer 14 years to be treated like a <unk> privileged <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there had been <unk> behavior on the <unk> in the behavior of the police and the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical and a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not just the <unk> but I had sent it to the cut.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it already.
And I finally said, "Oh my God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I was really <unk>
I went in the car court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
He finally went down the car. He walked into court.
I was going up the steps when I came up with a black man -- was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, she came up and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "I'm <unk> I said yes.
So I came up and approached me.
And I'm going to focus on the ear, and I was <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
I connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a sense of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
And when I walked in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> And we started going forward.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They got the cops follow the Taliban <unk> <unk>
And suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people. All excited because we were talking about races, because we're talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I was able to see the <unk> which was and <unk>
You would look out the window and let you hear all that <unk>
You're going to walk around here and for there.
Finally, this old black black, with a face of concern, I entered the room and sat behind me almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break an assistant.
The <unk> was <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we cannot truly be truly human humans, if we don't care about human rights, and for the dignity.
That our survival is connected to the other.
The visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the present people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Talk to hear and see a beautiful desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your way, to do something.
That's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities today.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to make a effort to fund the funds that they spend today in clinical <unk>
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years, billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of the homicide cases was not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of rapes don't get anywhere.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds were going to get these funds to make the law of security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe it is this?
<unk> Actually, the <unk> rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince us about the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people into the chain of <unk> to rob a bicycle, by small crimes of property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.

Oh my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months <unk> could be over the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media media would rather <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention to you.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survival, the first stop in all of those data is an old clip of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and recorded all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So from a <unk> of stories of stories, looking at the <unk>
That old saying of <unk> "If there are blood blood, it's very true.
And because all of the digital devices give us negative news -- the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, 24 hours a day, not surprising we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the quality of species, the lack of water and <unk> and <unk>
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we just ended with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita savings for inflation in the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of transportation and transportation and communications, has dropped from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful age of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy is about 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people will get it.
And we keep <unk> expectations higher and higher expectations.
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today, most of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> mobile TV, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is the technology and lately, its exponential progression.
My good friend of Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that you <unk> on information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the price of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
So why the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in the war and in peace, in recession depression and <unk>
It's a quick amount of sudden computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, and it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law -- there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, the robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize 3D production across the planet, synthetic biology, fuels and food, digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory of Watson, <unk>
It was spade.
I looked for the newspapers the best <unk>
And I loved this one: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for every cell on your phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can we be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every inhabitant on the planet, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that to be <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
Let me give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
Tell dinner the king of <unk>
The troops from Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the <unk> King ate with aluminum.
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal on Earth, it was more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the tip of Washington to Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal on the Earth.
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made aluminum something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
Let's get this analogy toward the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet that is about 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about lean and <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the fact that the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, the solar parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have water abundance too.
So let's talk about the wars for water.
Remember when Carl Sagan pointed out the Voyager Voyager toward the Earth, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent by water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, seawater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology that's available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of fresh water to the day of any saltwater <unk> seawater, a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola, just thought that I will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that I will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, I'm going to get to 70 percent penetration of the mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And from having a smart mobile phone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted ever.
They better than that, the things that you and I have paid for the things that you and I have paid for dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- images of books and music, electronic diagnostic technology -- now they're <unk> and they lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe you get the best part of it when the applications of your health.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the team of the world so that we get these technologies into a mobile device that you speak, and because it has <unk> you can be able to get blood out of the finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics that a <unk>
So imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the load of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this <unk> device is a virus of RNA or DNA that we don't want to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the largest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just had the mark of the 7 million.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, spending two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds have never seen before you get to the global conversation.
What will these people?
What do you say? What desires.
And instead of economic collapse, we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And the more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Academy Khan and because of the use of 3D impressions and computation on the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can they provide us three billion members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never happened to happen.
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What do you do?
And if they are contributions we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X Prize, is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a goal of course, can do things that were <unk> things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to finish by sharing a story that really struck me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how you fold the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played these college teachers in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came in, and they started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better folding than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the innovator of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are focused on to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades now.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very strict idea.
<unk> of <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It's actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them like very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they are <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a West West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot to the sun and I was convinced I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The water was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, some <unk>
There was <unk> about 20 centimeter -- the black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was getting more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five inches.
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1950s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite <unk> called <unk> four.
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in the south of the China Sea <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was a <unk> thing.
<unk> now the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are on the background.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny spots about <unk> remains that are fish <unk>
In short, the sea bottom came to the cover and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing.
The background happens to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once capture a alive.
He still wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are collected every time they go to a zone that they've never been fish.
But it's not been documented.
We don't remember.
It was <unk> the point of starting on the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at it something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, many of the <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the images that were going to start by the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and they extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the succession of changes.
And at the end of the end, I keep the <unk> remains.
And that, in big measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer than they were gone.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies die, they kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a big loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea synonymous with large fish.
They become <unk> because <unk>
With the time you have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientific, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a earlier way, it's not the way they would expect that to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> like the captain of a <unk> and so you can see a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally they use the scientists from fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
So the enormous role that it can happen to a protected marine zone.
Because with the marine protected areas -- we really <unk> the past.
<unk> the past people cannot conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area, and they can benefit from the vision that we can put on the <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have access, like the Middle West people, for example?
I think the arts and cinema may be <unk> the simulation.
This is a simulation of the <unk> Bay.
A long time ago there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you deal with the <unk>
Because it turns out something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one I give, is Cameron, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why videos are made viral and what important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, come forward in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
You get more than 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, only one small percentage is done with a myriad of it is receiving countless views and winning cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and a surprise.
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
KT: Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this shot out of his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the middle of the last summer.
<unk> did not do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this recommendation to the very popular video.
<unk> as Jimmy <unk> they present to us with new and interesting things and <unk> them to a larger audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start on Friday.   Everybody wants me to reach the end of a week, a week.   On Friday. <unk> on Friday.  KA: Would you think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos in the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have emerged from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day in particular <unk>
Well, I took <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science -- was one of the first people in making a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or an creators group will embrace a view and share it with a more broad, accelerating process.
So this community of people who share this big joke internal and then start talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other day.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an investigative animation, with a <unk> music.
It's like this, that's it.
This year was about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, to know that there is a three hours of three hours that has seen four million times.
And so far, you saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet Internet community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an old version of the old one.
And then it became international made.
Suddenly, the whole community came out with a community of <unk> which made this happen to be a joke silly to something that we can all become part of.
Because today is not just <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Black or <unk> <unk>
What else could I have been written to have written this situation?
In a world where two days of video came up with a minute, just the same thing and unexpected can be <unk> so these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against the <unk> to <unk> in New York City, I'm not interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was overwhelmed by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that you can prevent you properly through the <unk>
KA: Thank you the surprise effect and his humor, Casey <unk> I found that five million people saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is true for all of the new things we make <unk>
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> creative, creative communities of participation, the totally unexpected, are features of a new media type of a new culture, that we all have access and is the audience which defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all kind of <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media characteristics are barely the current means of today's media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
This is a poet, a man whose entire life had supported the unique hope of unity and freedom of his country.
<unk> while <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much friends, friends, now you know it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that be in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that history tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is on a boat at dawn <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life was destined to a <unk> task -- this family escape and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> <unk> that challenges the fiction, a boat was slid into the sea dressed in <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear of the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we asked ourselves, first we would take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the whole horizon and vacuum.
I don't remember the pirates who came several times, but they were tested with the courage in our boat, or the engine dying and not be able to pick up for six hours.
But I know the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, finish the journey was too much to get it; and the first apple I tried to, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had after the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is composed of immigrants from immigrants in them.
Unlike the middle class suburbs -- whose existence in <unk> was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the <unk> fragments that were <unk> between people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked on farms, and then on an assembly line of cars, working six days double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title for IT <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what it should be <unk> which was usually <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because he had to last six years.
And there was rare and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> back again."
At home, where?
One thing is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got sick about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the ship.
And my task was to be wake up until his nightmares started to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition, angry and <unk> and kids are caught in between two worlds.
They looked <unk> and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student with what I was afraid of myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But a lot of they got help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer they chose the young Australian year of the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges didn't happen.
As a <unk> resident <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist and social activist -- invited to speak in places that I had never heard of name, and houses whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the ship.
He didn't have been an option.
<unk> said to me, "What do not be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And the more I really talked about, the more it was to talk about to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were living on on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized that I couldn't stay in a <unk> race.
It had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's going to be a stranger, a little bit new at the scene -- and not only it's good, but it's something that is grateful, maybe a ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear.
<unk> that they didn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy out there, a optimism that is <unk> a very humility and <unk>
So my intuition.
They were going to be a small group of people who the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of each day, it was a giant <unk> <unk>
<unk> at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy but some brilliant, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the United States.
After a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and <unk> adventure.
Before the end, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up at a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person he cared for.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
The 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't get it wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
And I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called a minutes later.
Days later, later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure that we were still with it.
On the night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hands.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"They don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through the women.
Because of those who we were and how life built us, we now can see that men who had come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat had easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could I wish that to do it?
However, the privilege of the easy for the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a brave on every wave, the constant pace of the engine, the <unk> the vast horizon that won't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see them to secure it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is today on the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were a conversation about how nothing changed since the age of the former Indian <unk> <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and go back into the sky.
We now do it with airplane.
At that time, when I was looking at the great prince warrior Indian, I had <unk> I pulled a bow out and on the ground, there was water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we pulled out was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more about <unk>
I would give you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a child my grandfather gave me his grandfather <unk>
And this piece of <unk> <unk> was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world filled with images of pirate and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile clocks and the luxury clocks and the cameras will prevent them from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I came up with me -- I came to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It was <unk> books from the age of 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we took the book.
Where we are, where we are.
You put the text with the image, the sound and the touch.
The narrative becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that cause us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so ...  It says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back to a character of the book.
At a number of moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live with GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner child was excited to all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons but to that magic of childhood, those ideas that we were talking about children.
For some reason, the fireflies in a jar always turned me back to the <unk>
So over here, we have to change the iPad to liberate fireflies.
And really, they shine your way into what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated as a child was that a little girl in a <unk> galaxy.
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every fantasy book, there has always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that goes up, and it gets to you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another extremely important aspect to me is to create Indian content and contemporary art.
These are the <unk>
We all heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people out of India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped on the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that is about current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems for the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> they haven't left the world outside the world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure where we have to go outside the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
I had a little bit of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this ritual of childhood, you have to go out and in a chapter, you have a photograph to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
And so you create a digital collection of photos that you can then put on the Web.
A child in London puts a photo of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book, we have to have a interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through an augmented reality, and through <unk> you see a group of cartoons that appear on the inner inner skin.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves there.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and let them be able to read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature are associated with technology and magic and technology to each other.
It <unk> the energy of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves the natural world and that magic, joy and children's love that we sat through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about why a lot of projects from <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she stood up a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What do you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or perhaps not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to be heard.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> and flat surroundings.
Every morning I was hooked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I get married by my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor from <unk> has access to him as well, so he can see what my childhood problem is not at the same moment in which I need care support, or some urgency of that way, but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers, on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for the obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some activity in order to have more control of their health.
The next week is going to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a other device.
And people are <unk> from their houses, taking their blood pressure, they take their <unk> and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, <unk> to recover the control and being captains of their own <unk> but also help care about the health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing costs of attention to the cost of attention to the demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and begin with this to engage patients on the team.
And they can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did like to share it with you with a video.
We all have checks in <unk>
Maybe we have them on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATMs are <unk> in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but nobody else is <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves life at this time.
What we did was we made <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public audience -- you see a <unk> please get a <unk> where, and when it's open, because they just open up in the middle of the office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they had been introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody else -- you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use his cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also like <unk>
And we want to look at the world level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, so that we will help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody else -- it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us verify these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please stand up in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
It was mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because I used to use the camera that the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera that the process ends up when the <unk>
For me photography I had more than being in the right place at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
Let's get it out like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or you have pictures like <unk> dark and colorful people at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the whole level of it.
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can be <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> that you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to see with an idea that I have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that it does seem real <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
Would they raise light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end of the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we took different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way you can create something that still seems like <unk>
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's take the brain out, because the brain does not take the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture of it seem to be realistic I think they're those in which they don't even understand the things that are around us in our daily lives.
But when we combine photographs, it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something will be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures <unk> you must have the same type of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and end of the different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally comprised of photographs of different places.
In the personal ones, I think it's easier to create a place that would find out because you don't need to put the ideas on your mind.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores is a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, even I did the house from the top of the island to be more <unk>
So in order to make realistic outcome, I think it takes to planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different photographs.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures that you take the result can be very beautiful, and at the time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing you a slide on a very boring technology.
Please, you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details but the general place.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus power networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of other people we often see is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn it into the lights.
They had more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we look at technology curves.
The answer is that if you draw them on a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any kind of time, and this would be any of the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you were, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of <unk> transport as fast as the <unk> came tomorrow we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There is no precedent in the history of technological development of a gradual growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to argue is -- looking at these <unk> curves. We see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We had one of two things.
Or it's okay to become a typical curve -- I know like this until it comes something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, that I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition from what the world used to be in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask ourselves, is: what is that new way that the world?
What new is new to the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we are engaged in it.
I remember as a child in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different that they extrapolate what we're doing today does not make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is by taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time where I'd like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at it every billion years.
So you go back about two and a half billion years ago when the Earth was a big rock rock with a lot of chemicals that were going on around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized us, we give us a sense of how things are.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was some oil oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those blobs of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made them build the outside of the outside and the drops grew up grew up there.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time it was <unk> it would be a <unk> distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So each <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the droplets that somehow would be better at the time to incorporate the chemical <unk> more than the <unk> more chemists and more than <unk>
They usually lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, life -- very simple chemistry, but things become interesting when these drops and learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution without sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were in order to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being expressed exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did only by <unk> we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 percent of the white dust that I try to hide from the airport security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and it was 10 to the 22 times.
So if anybody wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> it would have put it in a virus and have spread it across the room.
What was the next <unk>
And writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells really happy about another billion years.
But then another big step came out in which things were very different, and it was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming in cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place to get communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals in that community to become more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities were approaching so much that, in fact, came together and decided to write the entire recipe for the community in a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And in that stage we have communities, communities of many different kinds of different types working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin of the skin is no without the heart of the heart, or your muscles or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and they had more interesting levels more interesting than cell phone, something that we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the <unk> devices that process the information that these mobile communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures in order to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time of evolutionary time.
So an organism can, for example, learn not to eat some fruits because he knew evil and sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years per death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system built these information structures completely accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communication trick of the communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea.
I'm sitting here sitting on <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take a very complicated thing to turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start working as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
We now went through similar periods to organisms -- <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
So the <unk> computer <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we have accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of history that told them they took a billion years every one.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, it took a few hundred million years.
The next ones, language, they took less than a million years.
And the next thing, like electronics, seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that speeds its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this <unk> explosion.
We see the process <unk>
But I make a life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent computer advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor is in that machine machine.
There are billions.
Instead of <unk> designers, we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that is something that you didn't can, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put it into the machine an evolutionary process operating on the size of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please flip you for a computer, you can run a hundred million <unk> <unk>
You could run these specific instructions sequences by random, to run all those programs, and take those more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to end up numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are most of the <unk>
Of course, there are unlikely of random sequences.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the order of the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that they did the <unk>
Let's get those and let's get them to the rest.
And now let's make sure that the <unk> of the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog analog to the <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who are <unk> <unk> and the children will <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
So a few mutations <unk>
And it tries to new and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that sequence numbers so utterly perfect.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to run them to see how they work.
They are strange programs.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know that, I have the safety of getting the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on this.
Once I was on a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and she gets a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, not make you feel <unk>
We know that the engineering process don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
But we don't understand all the choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so can be able to run these programs much more quickly.
So it is <unk>
The thing is getting faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at a moment analogous to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the end of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now I'm going to go lunch and I think I stop here before I got stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time for letting me give up part of my fake <unk>
Before we treat my talk, let's talk about a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're close to the end, the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of the <unk> the <unk> talking about statistics and used to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know about it.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> that we're going to save 300.
That means that <unk> bat is three from 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game of play without being <unk> and anyone who tries to give up the first base of the first base, not to time -- and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone from 10 <unk> it gets close four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player at the League Mayor of <unk> in running more 400 strokes into a regular season.
Now let's take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're attributed to a surgeon who has a record record in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a distant place, and a dear to have two <unk> <unk> <unk> and your family doctor derived a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But do you know anything?
She's getting a huge <unk> this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But let me tell you.
What do you think it must be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse, <unk>
We were very good.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, or a <unk>
What we do, however, is sending them to the world, and I would include the mandate of being perfect.
They never, would never, ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was in medical school.
I was a Creative Commons student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman until a blood test.
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence of Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my class of anatomy, the origin and the <unk> <unk> of every artery that comes out of each artery that comes out of <unk> climate diagnosis and <unk>
And I even knew the difference diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much as we get more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you were to take it out, then you would know everything, or the most possible thing to everything, because I get rid of the errors.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the lady to the lady in the emergency service where I worked on.
At the time, I was assigned to the <unk>
And when I went to the emergency room consult to a cardiologist and go to that patient.
And I was reporting to the chief of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard about a <unk> sound in both sides, which is a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working and, instead of burning the blood forward, the blood goes into our lungs, these are <unk> and that's why you have difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
And I gave him a little bit of water <unk> so that I could eliminate it.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I was very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, there would have been able to bring a little bit of <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident going to be a lifelong attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients with not even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they sent her home, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inner side that said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that I was asked to the nurse who went to the lady who went to the lady -- "Do you believe that he's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said to utter <unk> "Yes, I think it's okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed the <unk> and the ambulance with the ambulance were brought to their home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I was trying to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot and I walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. At that time I did something that I don't do normally,
I went through the emergency room of the way home.
And there was another nurse, not the name of the lady who came out of the lady -- I was told by three words, and he said three words -- those three words that most medical emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear it also, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and is that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: it remembers you?
Remember the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse in total <unk>
And they said, she <unk> the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I came back and on the edge of death.
At the end of an hour before I had reached his house, after I would give him the high and she had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> brought it to emergency room with a blood pressure <unk> which means a shock of severe <unk>
Just breathe and blue was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all their resources.
They gave her medication to get up blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and waiting for all the hope that they would expect.
And in the two or three days later, it was clear that they never danced.
He had permanent brain damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days or nine days, they were going into what was happening.
And by the ninth day, they let her go. Mrs. wife, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks next to me, I was excited about it and experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad inside.
It is the one that tells us not that what we did was so wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant that.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would get the things out and made sure that I didn't get stuck.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did I send him home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why did the medicine?
Little at this feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And in a <unk> day, you opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I would take the efforts to be perfect for not to make more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
It went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an organization in the emergency department in a community hospital in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, was a little <unk>
He <unk> <unk> and he sent him home.
But while he ran to the door he was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my shift from guard, my chief asked to speak to me <unk> in his office.
And he made the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but the top goes higher and it can cause the close of those tracks.
He didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then <unk> and went back to work, until over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> I didn't see the <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially to work in a hospital, because they went to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it was a <unk>
One of them thought I had a unified calculation of it.
And it turns out an X-ray of your kidneys -- but it turned out, a colleague that I was checking to the patient -- some sensitivity to the lower right-hand quadrant, and he called a surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I got liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I looked at it and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, he called a surgeon.
They were both operated and recovered as well.
But every single case, I was hooked.
But I would like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
They are embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: If I can't get it back and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach them this so that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would walk into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg, believe it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that forget that they cannot sleep, and the ones I know; they have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction, as antibodies you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get rid of the medicine to people who make mistakes, will be a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a bad medical school and medical study and physicians to learn what it was from the first article that I wrote to the Toronto "Star to my <unk> <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes are happening every day, where one in 10 drugs are happening in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections, are increasingly and more <unk> to chaos and death.
In this country, 6,000 Canadian Canadian -- <unk> medical errors.
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is multiplying every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story was <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we get rid of us, and we eliminate all the professional professionals -- well, I'm not going to stay anywhere.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> white art, it's a custom saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everyone, from the <unk> to the chief of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, "What are your <unk> And <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> they would go down to the head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You could say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a medical medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The doctor <unk> is human, you know, they accept it, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teaching others.
They had their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the errors of other people not with the intention of other people, but in a loving way, and the support of the support for all of us.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes at the time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I am human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember it.
Do you know how many choices we take one day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick a half a half a day.
Not long ago, in a research followed for a week to a group of chairs of companies.
The researchers recorded all the different <unk> tasks for these executives and the time that we would engage in making related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> works a week.
<unk> every job included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required for an hour or more of their time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How does the way that we deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the greatest problems of <unk> choosing to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When I ask a question, like I am blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
On the other way, when you ask a question, if your response is positive for you, please give up.
And now my first day on the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket, at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and some 25 water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the <unk>
I loved going to that tent, but I once asked myself, "Why do I never buy anything?
This is the shelf <unk>
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in the <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit a manager and I asked him, "Do you have this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed out with the buses full of tourists that came out every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
So hall.
They had <unk> different classes.
He put a <unk> <unk> just to the entrance to the store.
We put it out there for six <unk> or 24 tastes like that, and we looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 60 percent, which when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also look at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
Of the ones that stopped when there was only three percent of us got to buy <unk>
What stood up when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, let's decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> <unk> less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the overload of choices affects us in <unk> decisions.
We decide not to decide, even when we don't get stuck.
Now the subject of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to tell you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the decisions about savings for retirement of about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from a million of the plans of this country.
And we were interested in seeing if the number of funds available in savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that I actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two, to 59 options.
We found that the bigger the number of funds, they had fewer participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And on the plans that offer about <unk> the rate of participation went into the 60.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, even in that case, there is unintended consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people are interested in preventing actions or hedge funds.
The more they had more options, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But none of these really extreme decisions are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize human financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we make the decision, the decision, even when it goes against self-interest.
They are more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it will be better.
And the main reason is that we are able to look at that variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, with a contrast and choice of that amazing <unk>
Today I want to show you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in a way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less true than today.
People have always bothered when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But what we're looking at is actually what we are looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of the odd choices, there will be an increase at sales sales, the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products to waste the cats that are less <unk> grew up the <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> greater sales and <unk>
You know that today's supermarkets. They give them 45,000 products.
In a store of Walmart they provide about 100,000 products.
But the largest largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce.
In the world of the financial savings -- I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how to handle the choices is the author of David <unk> the Harvard <unk>
All the employees of Harvard are forced to automatically be able to be able to be able to come alive.
Those who really want to choose, are given 20 funds, not 300 or more.
They already know that people are often saying, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that you have between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, either.
This afternoon, before this session, before this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer the people in this audience with all paid the world's most beautiful highway in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> Okay. So what is ready to embrace the deal.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think it really was to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information in the first trial, which in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it be more real.
So this brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the overload of which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between options, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be very <unk> very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when they use debit cards or credit cards than when you use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it be more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And to that meeting that <unk> exactly like <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we gave the staff to think about the positive things that they would ask in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine aisle we made.
What we saw is that in the supermarket.
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
<unk> Okay, so there are some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know anything?
This is a completely useless.
The categories must indicate something that they <unk> not to the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge fundraising.
Why are they going to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about if just <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a <unk> decision.
This is a German German maker.
You have to take 60 choices to put the car.
And these choices vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> color outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box four options.
What I'm going to do is vary the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients is going to go from many options, 56 colors, just about four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go out of a choice, four <unk> at 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much you are.
If you were <unk> the default button in every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones who come from many choices to <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, keep there.
Same information, the same piece of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which information comes from.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although you pick the box out of change doesn't tell me about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of <unk> <unk> eliminating alternative alternatives -- allowing them to make it <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better, for you to use them in their own business, or for people to work.
So I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful to the <unk>
And the more careful we are in our best choices we can practice art art.
Thank you very much.
In the years <unk> in the <unk> East Germany, if you had a typewriter that had a typewriter to write to the government.
I had to record a piece of text from example written with the machine.
And the government could track the origin of your texts.
If they found a written on the wrong message you could trace the footprint into the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think of somebody who could do this, how much that would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and prints it on a page, that end page by having some yellow yellow dots printed on every page that follow a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be very much like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
You're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amount of huge money.
There are actually a lot of <unk> online cases, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means, through the <unk> of our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret service of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say today is more likely than any of us will be a victim of a <unk> which is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be wrong with worse.
In the future, most of the crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, and the protests motivate them to motivate them to motivate them to motivate you.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the national governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually it was.
<unk> the <unk> last fall due to a <unk>
And we had the security of the site and a <unk>
Last week, I asked, at a meeting with representative government representatives asked one of the leaders if you were to <unk> <unk> the death of people from the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a heart attack.
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Why is the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> based on the <unk> secret police headquarters and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 15,000 euros to the Afghan government.
The company based on the company is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools for the governments that do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you were suspicious of a criminal case, well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
It was <unk> the connection to the Internet.
You know, even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the media, and listen to the online online to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be, "Well, it looks something bad, but it really doesn't affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why would we care?
I have nothing that we <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today, any right right now to be able to be forever.
Are you going to <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the south of Park, National Park.
So these are the cows of my Dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, National Park.
The National Park of Nairobi has no fences at the most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate out of the park.
And predators, like the lions, they go, and this is what they do.
He <unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed the night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and so we value them so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
People are the warriors they protect our community and livestock and livestock -- and they're also angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at age six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions gave them fear.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because it was even helping lions see the pen at a distance.
I didn't tell you, <unk>
A second idea was using a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so that they believed that I was near <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were -- but the second day, they came back and said, this thing is not moving, and it's always here.  So he went and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come.
And I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which it turns out to turn out the lights.
And this is a little <unk> of a <unk>
We got it all.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity on the tiny box -- I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> give us out, because that's where lions.
And that's what lions see when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> the lions for you to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never went back to have problems with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals killed and asked me if I could put the lights out.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them in seven houses in my community and they're serving very much.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to frightening other predators as hyenas, <unk> and it's also using to get rid of their farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the <unk> <unk> cows and I used to see flying planes and told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in aircraft for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer, when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now like my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other <unk>
What's the next one on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electric fences -- but I want to make mine.
CA: So you know, you know, it turns out it once once, right? And I've tried it before, and I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot of four, Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We are going to <unk> in every step that I would have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk>
And I was very proud.
In school, we went all the time studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
But sometimes I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until it all changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my colleague from my sister.
That he said, "When you <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two past weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
He was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train, station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child in his arms watching his mother without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine ripped back to North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, more than a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and tree.
They also became more and more prevalent the energy energy energy -- all of me was completely dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just across the river from my house.
I always asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korean at night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, you see bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of the North Korea, but I can only tell you that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with relatives parents.
But I just thought I would be separate from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live like a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But I suddenly learned that it's not only extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugees North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destination back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and I was standing in the police station.
Somebody had been accused of being <unk> then I would get my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I got to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China are looking for asylum.
But many of them may be arrested for the Chinese police force.
These women were very lucky.
Although there had eventually been released by a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China, and we monitored North Korea, where they are <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape, a lot of other North Koreans have not had so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight that hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and find work, everybody can be <unk> in a second.
This is why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to save in South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korean was a much more challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South south.
We're all <unk> but on the inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
They even went through an identity.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with pride of mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the school exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities -- the North Korean authorities -- some money that sent back to my family, and, as I blame my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location outside the <unk>
They had to flee it immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korean and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China, and I walked to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then across Southeast Asia.
The trip in <unk> took a week, and we almost went caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked you all of you all and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but I was fortunately I was for.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards guards, in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned in crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the oldest dots in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to my family, but my family was <unk> in prison at the short distance of the South Korean embassy of the South.
I was going to come between the office of immigration and the police station, and desperately trying to release my family to my family.
But it didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man said, "What's the problem?"
I was so shocked that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family, and for two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I took my whole heart, and I said, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping the village to <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown was <unk> a new hope for me and to the <unk> people when they were <unk>
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community is really the <unk> that the <unk> people needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went back to a new country, they begin with little or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices in the English language, the labor of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea, and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are following in contact with relatives still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you'll see more and more North Koreans -- all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is the <unk> <unk> stores of fast food <unk>
So the planners of the city came together, and they thought, we're going to change the South South Pole so that it represents something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles as if this is actually going to be wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles -- <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center for the home places to drive and eat in the car.
And the curious thing is that the food places to carry kills more people in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles South America.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times greater than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how do you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come out and see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs of flashy wheels, and sold as self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers.
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and the solution.
And then I got tired of driving 45 minutes back and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 meters three feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it down.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me -- because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to keep it.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we got together and we started planting our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine green vegetables are there.
What we do -- we are sort of a group of paid by <unk> by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is for free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone was <unk>
The city went on top of it, and I was given a <unk> saying that he had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made order of <unk>
And I said, "Come on in it?
A court order for planting food on a piece of land that no one was <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's get it."
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> Green members who put a petition on <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's go, why not?
L.A. is the city of American <unk>
It has 68 miles of <unk>
That's like 20 <unk>
That's enough space for planting <unk> millions of blood plants.
Why the hell does it look like this?
You took a plant to give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South Pole.
I grew up there, I grew up there.
I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Like an artist of <unk> that <unk> walls, me <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It will be <unk> to see what the earth can do.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how does people affect people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
It was <unk> to see how it affects the boys.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and thought that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one time, who came a mother and daughter was like the <unk> at night and were in my garden, salt and look very <unk>
I, man, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why do I do this, people ask me, "You know, not temes that people go to steal your <unk>
I mean, "Of God no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at his time, I want you to take your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared me with his stories about how this had affected me and how it used to plant their mom and his grandmother, and was great to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So <unk> Green has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We had, like about 50 people that come, work and <unk> all of the volunteer plan.
If the kids grow up, they would eat the guys will eat <unk>
If you grow some tomatoes, you will eat <unk>  But if none of this will tell you, if you don't teach them how the food affects your mind and the body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing where you're stuck with the color of color that are on this way that they designed to them, that it doesn't bring them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to be able to train their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block from gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I didn't tell me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
Curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is putting people to work to people, to get kids out the street, who know the joy, the pride of pride and honor to cultivate their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy here.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
The <unk> take your <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, you don't call it any comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to kindergarten.
<unk> Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> --  -- you probably all agree with me that this is a very bad road.
It's made from <unk> and asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as it rains so much.
You can have a huge amount of water in asphalt that you know.
And especially if they go on your bike, and these cars go on that is not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt is able to make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a road <unk>
The solution for that is to make roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use right now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, have pores and water can go through it, so all the water flow flow upward into the sides and have a road because it's easy to drive, and you don't get rid of the water anymore.
Noise is also disappear.
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the stones on the surface of the surface of the surface.
First a stone, then several more and more and more and more and more and more and so on, and you can make it <unk> -- but you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also take more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be turned on a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how the damage comes into this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so you only have a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> -- this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you will get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material wrong, then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use knitting wool from that to clean up, and we can cut the steel wool into smaller pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel on it.
And then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat up, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the stones will be <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the show that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the sharks.
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We have to <unk>
So we got a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did here. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then of course, this road lasts for several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of load on them, the course of the course of our <unk> machine, and we put it back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, in closing, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel, bringing these fibers, using the power of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even they can even double the life of the surface.
And now, of course, they have curiosity that it also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
You actually have to cool it first before I can show you how I can play it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember <unk> a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC on his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is generally <unk>
"The Pakistani Taliban screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school school, he told me.
One morning I never forget.
True school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban was <unk> in Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was struck as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside to go to a secret school.
It was the only way we were two to <unk>
Every day, we had a different route so that nobody could be suspect to where they were.
We had to hide the books in commercial bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
School was at a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Occasionally the school suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Pakistani Pakistani Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is?
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and daughters was a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> in that his daughter, my mother, my mother, out to the school, and so his father was <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took off two years ago, just to turn our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate her children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there was moments when I was very frustrated for our life and she was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. Can you stop leaving your house during a war.
But there's one thing that always will be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want not to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the high school, and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate from <unk> College.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> their home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't only lie from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I carry it driving around the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador of <unk> a global campaign to educate the women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, even though even in front of a surgical opposition.
As <unk> it's not his name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When I got to his house, you're the phone, a voice <unk> that if I kept sending his daughter to school, I would get it to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but I don't harm the future of my old child and <unk>
What I've realized in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of whom <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and that he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been the key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first compelling <unk> of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
On the <unk> the girls who went to school they count in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is just as different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They would argue that these changes didn't last last long, after the retirement of the U.S. troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students at my school and his parents who were asking for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future and lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the little girls in <unk> I would love it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never have a revolutionary <unk>
It's almost two years since the Copernican revolution was inspired by the surge of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as well as the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the regime <unk> of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were <unk> were in the edge, <unk> the fall of the regime, by carrying <unk> freedom and social justice.
You've shown a courage <unk> to face the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to west, west, south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a few losses about losses about about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> I left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of the society?
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved many other women, rebuild the civil society <unk> <unk> a progressive and fair transition to democracy and national <unk>
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> roughly 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing capacities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we started the <unk> of Women of Women <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> leaders, of <unk> to advocate for the women's autonomy of the woman and for our right to participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period -- an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than <unk> of the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was unanimously and successful.
Women won a <unk> of Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and revolution like everything, it was <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> of <unk> old and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news from the murder of military officers from the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and the human <unk> human rights human rights and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made by a democratic mindset -- it becomes more, and it's removed from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here right here at all to <unk> with our history of the success of <unk> <unk> and elections.
Rather, I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose <unk> we make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize okay.
Because elections didn't brought the peace and stability and security in Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought up peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination, and <unk> for men for women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus most of what the election needed to be <unk> and <unk>
Our nation needs the women's representation of the female who needs the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as honor agents and call a few days of anger.
We need to start acting as compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not just <unk> but it also puts <unk> rather <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration rather than the competition, the inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideal that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately desperately needs to end the end of achieving peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way, before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> that spans the entire humanity of the men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have been <unk>
And so just like the uterus completely cover the <unk> which grows inside, the divine extracellular matrix of compassion all of existence.
So this is what he goes, "My mercy looks all the things."
And this is what he goes, and "My mercy is <unk> about my <unk>
They are all given to the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a startling question, which has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that they all do -- why she is left?
Why would anybody stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a <unk> a social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
He was 22 years old. He was just <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> I would hit my head with a <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved one who loved one in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a spiritual trap <unk> <unk> where they fall every year of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University, and I have an MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working companies, <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Post.
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can go to anyone, all the races, all the religions, all the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse -- and domestic abuse -- or the domestic abuse -- or that kind of way, in the families, the last place we want or we expect or we would expect the <unk> reason why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that I would have been the last person in the world that would stay with a man who loves him and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
He was 22 years old, and in the United States of the age of 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence -- which of all ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or your patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, November night of January.
I was sitting next to me at the subway in New York and started to <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had just taken away from a university from the <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me at that first meeting was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field.
I had a few great <unk> like apples, and a hair, wheat, and it looked so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things he made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
It made it about everything at the beginning of a <unk>
We started coming out and loved everything from me who was so list that I had gone to Harvard and put passion in helping teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know that all about my family, my childhood and my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me as a writer and as a woman, like nobody had ever done it.
And it was why the council in that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and leaving the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I thought, I left my work and <unk> and I went out of Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling on a <unk> <unk> who was getting into a head on a physical trap financial and psychological trap carefully <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
So as much as we moved to New England you know, that site where he was supposed to be so sure I bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one was kept under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that he needed those guns to the trauma that they lived in a small age.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me and, although I never got up my hand, my life was already serious about danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was the seven in the morning, and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I gave me the girlfriend of my mother and married him with him.
Even though what had happened, I was really sure that I was happy for always, because I loved him and he loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had a lot of <unk> for the wedding and the fact of making a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I had never been hurt.
I spent twice in our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> various times the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of the honey moon was <unk> by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac <unk>
<unk> went to <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Disease Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was using me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deep <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help <unk> to deal with the <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is: Why don't you just be <unk>
Why not <unk> me could have been at any time.
For me this is the most sad and agonizing question that people do -- because we, the victims, we know something that you would usually <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of violence in domestic violence occur after the victim was finally completed the relationship, after <unk> because then <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after <unk> has gone to marry, <unk> of financial resources, and it manipulation of the family support system for <unk> to the victim and their children, who are usually forced by judges to spend time with the man who went to their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's just not doing?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> hanging out that I beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it was allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the world to the police, to my neighbors and my friends and family, all of strangers, and I'm here today because all of you love me.
We have the trend to <unk> victims like <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
<unk> for some people is a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the <unk> victims were deliberately shutting down men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also believe that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them and that <unk> their lives joyful and happily like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that I actually am a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very typical in domestic violence.
And I went back to <unk> with a cute old man, and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I didn't get back to have ever more, is a <unk> gun pointing to my head on someone else's hands who says that I will.
At this moment, the same is thinking, <unk> -- that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
<unk> could be affecting their daughter, his sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love -- particular love to break the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last petition to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse of abuse are only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence, just shedding light on it.
We are victims we need all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
<unk> the abuse of the light talking about it with their kids, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of the survivors like fantastic people who have a fantastic future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene in consciously, to stop your climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the self-interest and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I am called Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed in the room because I should not have dressed in my <unk>
This is the first shift in clothing on a <unk> stage, so you have a lot of sort of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are getting sick when they <unk> they don't have to stand up now, but we find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everyone has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to pass this sweater out of your head, because it's when you're going to laugh for me, so you don't do anything while I cover my mind.
All right.
So why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this photo.
appearance is powerful, but also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and a photographer said to me that he was going to get it back and I would get the hair of the kid.
Of course, with surgery, or an artificial tan like that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do to transform our surroundings, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, and in my labor sector that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get a role model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, what we're biologically programmed to do -- we also have associated with a high and <unk> shape -- shape <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to use to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience that now shows <unk> and maybe there are some of them <unk> that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing how much models. It's amazing.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, they weren't white percent.
The next question that people always ask me is: Would you be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know about that.
But then, what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you would be the first.
If after this spectacular <unk> still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the chief of writing of American journal or the executive executive or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have a pick up your studies, and you have a mate and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you <unk> you want to be president of the United States -- but you have to say that you want to be president of the United States, for 10 years, people would look strange for you.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I thought about -- and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're moving into the personal field, but it was a child.
So it looked next to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party.
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those pictures.
They are <unk> of a professional professional group, <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: do things for for free?
I have too many of you from eight inches and never use, except for the previous one, but the privileges I get to be the ones I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the free dress.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> <unk> a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges by my aspect, not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their mind regardless of who they are.
I live in New York, and last year of the <unk> teenagers who were <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black men and Latino men in New York -- for what for them, is not a question of <unk>
And how many times do I get <unk> and <unk>
And when I investigate this talk, I found out that 53 percent of <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question people ask me is: How is life of a role model?
And I think the answer that you expect to is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give you an answer that maybe you can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, clever and passionate people.
And all of that is true, but it's only one part of what happens, because what we never say before the cameras, I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself with a smaller legs and the most brilliant hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs -- the brightest hair and the most brilliant hair, but probably be the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was difficult to look at a situation of racial race, and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that will hold out of this talk, I hope that everyone will feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was more enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more interesting photos and I didn't go to me who owns them.
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even minimal care in the lighting.
In fact, most of you took them tourists randomly.
My story begins when, in the city of New York City to give me a <unk> my wife brought me this photo holding my daughter on his first birthday. That is the corner of 57 and 5.
I happened to happen to New York City just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you get to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
So here is when we started asking for the tourists that passed to the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever been <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much we would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five-year-old child could understand.
These pictures are much more than a specific moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop the time in October week and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, not just at the physical, but in all the senses.
Because, while we always get the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter is new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how they perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion every year.
Recently, in one of the travel, we were walking around, we were walking out in dry and pointed out in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls that <unk> small views on the previous <unk>
And he described to me what it had felt at the age of five years in that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of being actively engaging in the collective creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides all 15 pictures, I don't get out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that brings out the photo.
So today, I want to encourage everyone to come up in the picture, and I didn't want to go close to somebody and asked, "We've got a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> <unk> group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughs as a silly silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the printing press, laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with the Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't clean the environment the environment --  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far away from <unk>  And -- and my favorite, the <unk> they have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are mainly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the World Bank, where we have 16 species. Of these 16, 11 different risk of extinction.
So why is the <unk> that are important -- first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They are our <unk> of natural garbage ingredients.
<unk> the people to the bone.
They help kill all of the bacteria they will absorb the anthrax that they wouldn't be because they would stretch and caused great losses and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses are taken from three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
The <unk> also have enormous importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the dancer and the maternity symbol and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit of the United States and lower Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the <unk> god and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there's conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the endangered endangered list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason it is because they fall prey from the livestock of livestock that has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> it has a huge amount of time bomb to <unk> the number of cases of anger has raised enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to the birds. They cut them in half.
These are birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible <unk> trade to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so I will focus on a consumer problem.
We need to work with the governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures. It will be <unk> their time to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, you would tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with their kids, with your neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed it because he saw it with no effort, no energy expenditure in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life -- has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> and Somalia. In projects of technical cooperation with African countries.
I worked for a NGO NGO and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
We went to the 21, that Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa.
Instead of that, everything that we would expect, the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where a lot of Italians decided to teach people of Zambia to grow food.
So we got a little bit of <unk> <unk> in southern Zambia to this absolutely wonderful valley that descends into the <unk> River and we teach the local growing tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so they were going to be told to come to work, and sometimes they didn't get rid of --  -- we were very aware that the local <unk> in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't get rid of it, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> for time to save the people from Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown up.
We got these gorgeous <unk> In Italy, a could grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful and <unk> and red, at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "God mine, <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you tell him, "You're never going to be <unk>
I thought only about the Italians -- <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, they were doing the English -- what the French did, and then what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
You would see the <unk> --  -- to see the waste that we gave the <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was released in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
You just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries infections, and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if I were my sons, "I want you a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if I was my <unk>
So whites in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face, the small thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development -- if people don't want to be <unk>
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided for the 27 years only answer to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local <unk> who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you? Do you <unk>
It never gets to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people in the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met at a coffee -- we met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become a friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody an idea.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you?
The passion that she has for his own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for a time, but not in family meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunities have they <unk>
So the planning has this blind point at the moment.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't touch their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new career.
The profession is the doctor of the company, the doctor of the business, the doctor of the business of the business, that it sets up with you at your house, at the table of your kitchen table in coffee, and help find the resources to transform their passion in a way of making a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to move away from this condescending garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on the march, and the government came to me to see the question, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very, very hard.
And --  So --  So --  So --  So --  -- so the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most successful business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before you get involved in business -- and this is what Peter <unk> says Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a dairy economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the corporate spirit.
So now we have <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you for sure that you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people -- intelligence and passion?
What do you show you about the morning for you.
Local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit of an entrepreneur is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossils that are not renewable energy, and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, the <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a lovely story that in a research magazine ago, many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the course of the year, they got together this group of people, and I went back to what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the bottom line was <unk> the city of New York wasn't there in 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic generic companies.
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they will not come to talk with you.
And then you have to offer you an absolute <unk>
And then I later have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, it has to be able to do three things, which is the product that you wish to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing and you have to have a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a only human being in the world that can be done, selling and looking for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked and observed the 100 companies across the world -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all new companies, Google <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one: no one was started by one person.
I didn't have the word wrong, but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
No one starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business in <unk> in coffee bars with their dedicated <unk> in bars with their dedicated <unk> who do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who speaks about this <unk> someone who asked you, what would you need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Okay, so you can <unk> You can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of the people around us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a <unk>
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for the cows stores so that our communities can reflect our needs.
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the <unk> giant <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries, and I trust a city.
It always gives you to accommodate music --  there's a <unk> in New York City --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most <unk> number of <unk>
I live near this house and thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009 I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and death.
And this was a profound gratitude for the time and the time.
It gave him clarity to the significant things in my current life.
But let's take this look in my daily life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch on the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the <unk> help and new friends transformed the wall of this home house on a giant board and painted on it on her phrases for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and he was still <unk>
And I'd like to share some of the things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they die -- I want to be applied to <unk>  "Before I die I want to sit in the <unk> of <unk>
Before we die of dying I want to sing to millions of people.
"Before they die I want to plant a <unk>
"Before they die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before we die of dying I want to give you one more."
"Before they die I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
"Before they die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is trying to accommodate the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of some of the passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the civic center of the civic center, we made a kit and now taken walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we showed the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions developing, it's more important than ever, to find the ways of conserving the perspective and remember that life is very quickly.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that will cause us more power.
And when you think about the death of our life that our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care as individuals and as community and more means to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us cannot only help improve places, it can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very hot.
You don't speak, but it brings better joy than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
<unk> <unk> happen what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences and notice about this: has never been <unk>
When I sing songs about our childhood, trying to love the words that I couldn't even think of it, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when I came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, <unk> in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like <unk>
But most people don't agree.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what it propelled my heart to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if you didn't consider it inside the <unk> that might mean one thing that was <unk> <unk> and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
In every single individual in the individual in a different way, that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, a new case is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disruption that is faster in the world, there is no cause no cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years ago when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new being in my life.
When a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, didn't seem very interested in me at all.
It was living and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in line around the room, looking at the washing washing machine, and eat anything that was <unk>
As I was growing up, it would get more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without credit -- a human being never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there has been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish I were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things that would not want to change by normal.
<unk> is about high the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean anybody else is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and of you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that you <unk> are a <unk> each of us has a gift on their inner inside and honestly, the search for normal, is the last sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what had been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me a professor of communications, who would give a communication class to engineering.
I was scared --  -- really, of these students with their great minds, their great book and the great green and unknown words.
But when those conversations grew up, I felt what <unk> had felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt like I was when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised to the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges, from energy to the environment and health care and whether we don't know this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get together with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see this science is sexy and its engineering is attractive.
First question for us, and so what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't you tell us that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat the <unk>
And when you're describing your science, caring for <unk>
<unk> is a obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them dumb ones.
On the contrary, as Einstein said everything as easy as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> the bullets are killed, and the <unk> and the <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's <unk> too much in the language of our brains and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique <unk>
And the trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then can provide graphics that we prescribe our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just some keys that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, by all of the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the favorite words of the Oxford English is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge, no matter -- and that when he wins, and that, when he wins, gets it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that they were told in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was thanks to the courage of a guy who was <unk> <unk> who was confronted by <unk>
She got thrown at the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> so <unk> <unk> like the <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
And they had been introduced all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some of them wanted to call him <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They didn't think it was treated quality.
And not even with that were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for a fixed deadline.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired -- because this debate was happening for three weeks.
I read the daily from a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be able to care about power.
They didn't want to call him the King if he was giving him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the most <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate title that we came in.
And that title was <unk>
President. Not invented the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> presidents of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take a serious title with a ridiculous title and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate is not <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one, and this is my favorite way to where I've been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> the President's title.
The President Barack Barack is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> that we keep waiting for <unk>
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most important thing -- and with this is that the President of the United States is not at all so modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air air is not manned and so on.
The reality and history has endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, looked like -- well, it was a uniqueness of the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the <unk> <unk> and so on.
So at the end of the Senate I won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that you're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give it to you.
The politicians are trying to pick up and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, really changes a lot more the words that they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to feet under land in a illegal mine.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones with primitive tools.
Like others, I have a cheap amount of light on the <unk> and it holds the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely see the <unk> the branches that hold the walls of that hole in that hole that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly remember a mining that I met days before, who lost control and dropped countless meters on that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys today, these guys are deep in that hole at the heart of your life without paying a reward and, often dying.
I went out of that hole and went home but they may never do it because they are prey to slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor to be the only <unk> in the Rio <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO that is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not to the grade.
When we ended up talking to me and I was very sad, I was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got choked up the stomach and weeks later, I flew in Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
A few of a few of a second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of Africans displaced during the entire slave slave during the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire slave slave for the entire
About 150 years ago, the cost of a slave salary was about three times the annual salary of a U.S.
This is equivalent to about 50,000 people today.
But today, you can sacrifice entire families for generations for generations of 18.
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 30 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with a lot of <unk> promises of good education and better work to then find out that they are forced to work with no threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today the slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves being value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists in almost everyone and yet, it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the ancient Egypt or the <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees of men, men, women, in fact, families -- entire families -- <unk> on their heads until 18 to 18 at the time, and they take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of feet.
<unk> for <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> made it a lot of <unk>
As <unk> they were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to play and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> not <unk> Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizen of that country.
He could put it in a better situation that they were already before.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his liberation and he trusted that he <unk>
At the way to me, I waited to get home to feel my heart heart.
In the Himalayas, I found kids <unk> <unk> for miles per mile to <unk> to the trucks they were waiting at the bottom.
Those big <unk> were much more heavy than the children who were released and the children put them on their heads and their <unk> made out of <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing with what to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> their freedom, the <unk> have completely <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often think of sexual trafficking, and because of this world consciousness advised me to be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was passionate about women who had been previously <unk>
It was brought up on the stairs <unk> that gave this hot basement, faint <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was rather a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, is local for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of the only seven years -- they are forced to entertain the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided into a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer from sexual abuse to their clients.
From foot in <unk> I remember making sense of <unk> <unk> and at that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the steps in where they <unk>
There was no secret doors.
There were no windows for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult topic -- it's important to point that slavery even sexual trafficking, is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300 Americans are sold every year as sex use.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk <unk>
This is a family of family.
Your hands black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk on the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me the stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
You know, yet we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in the lake -- the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we came, I went to a quick look fast.
I saw what appeared to be a family family in a boat, two brothers, a few older kids, a few younger kids, it makes sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families, and they were forced to work with <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> I know her little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling to water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> and often they sell networks and children, and with fear, they become the water to unleash the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since <unk> has always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> it comes to the younger slaves under his command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when I went to the last networks, but they had been working on the last time.
<unk> and <unk>
And it might point out that these networks weigh more than 400 pounds when they're loaded with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met it in a refuge where I was looking at the <unk> <unk> of slavery.
Kofi is the possible.
Who will get to be because someone decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with partners from <unk> the <unk> a teammate who was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
And he asked us to take it on a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would tell us to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out quickly.
Then he pointed out this path barely visible and said, "This is the road, this is the road.
As we started going, we removed the <unk> that I would take on the way and after walking around an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos about my head as I went to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path, he ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field, and they were full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children bound to their backs, and, while they were looking for gold, <unk> in the waters with <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the well they were <unk> in your own sweat.
I remember he looked at his eyes, tired, <unk> because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The wells have up to 90 feet and these people carry heavy stone bags and then they'll be shipped to another area where they were able to pull the gold out to be able to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look close to the fence, we see a lot of the <unk> and we see other fewer children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence and violence.
In fact, it's very likely to end up as well as this victim of T.B. and the <unk> of <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> -- I did inherit the uncle of the uncle who force it to the mines.
When I met him, he had worked on mines 14, and the leg injury that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and nevertheless, it's forced to work and day in that mine.
Yet, he would be released with being released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of a face to a remote possibility, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw a light on <unk>
Did you know that your images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we're going to be testimony to them and we're going to do everything in order to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not for magazines. It's the real people like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day that I think I don't think of these so many beautiful people -- I think I've had the great honor to meet.
And I hope that these images are tracking a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that the force will turn a fire, and that <unk> fire on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I perform <unk> and there is a peculiar problem for whom <unk> we are like the management programs.
No one knows what the heck we do.
And so today, I will try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We get rid of the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk> -- that we'll see later on.
But the celebrity is a degree of training, extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably a very high <unk> <unk> that you can have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease will gradually gradually see this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at their time, was a virtuous dancer ballet <unk>
Over the last few years has become a lot of progress on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and, ultimately, the only way we will know if there really is a cure when we have an objective measure and a <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there are no biological markers, That's why the blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological exam for 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, they never get done.
What if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic and what if patients could get the exam to do them with ourselves?
It didn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to refer to you as a conventional form for a try, you see, in some sense at least we are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> ropes.
It shows someone healthy as it emits sound at the talk, and we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes needed -- <unk> for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that brings a child to learn how to speak.
From the sound, we can trace the position of vocal cords as it <unk> and like Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom plot you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of <unk> ropes.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
And both of them are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They're very quickly, they take 30 seconds like a lot.
They are minimal cost, and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a lot of <unk> cost on mass scale.
These are some incredible goals to help address.
We can reduce the patient <unk> of patients.
I don't have to go to the clinic for <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get goals.
We could make it a massive <unk> mass for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it is too late.
So by giving the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Parkinson's condition of disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of the voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> or Parkinson's disease, it can call low price and leaving recordings for a cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can tell who they're healthy and who doesn't?
What will you get from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yes, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Right.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> It may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, it's important because we are looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion for the actual markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> precision at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work, and now he has shown that it works on the mobile phone grid, also what we did the project. We now have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March the 2011, I was in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We lie in the dark, on the dark, without windows and usually, we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin, and even more perfect -- we make it possible, and we were interested in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that was happening in Japan.
Shortly after, an organization where I was <unk> there was a <unk> that was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 of May, I went to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village located in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people that were affected by the wave.
On the level of water recorded it reached over 24 feet tall and more than three kilometers into the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime out, and we leave ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both of the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
We would have to take them to different places of villages around <unk>
It wasn't until then I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
While he was fleeing the wave, and to save her lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
I helped clean the toilets, giant <unk> gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And so there were the honor that I had the honor that that day I would play in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression of thinking beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went through my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years old -- I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and knew that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the appearance of her, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo <unk>
Over the step of time, they came out of luck more photos and they took more <unk> so it went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries was offered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got to <unk> a village to north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the temporary <unk> libraries that had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
And the time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
I could be <unk> for an hour. I could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw almost by hand using a guide to the areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
It took a lot of time.
And the water will destroy all these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered with algae with algae with algae with algae with algae with algae with algae and even the time of the time I continue to <unk> that was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean -- dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have the guide of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm the pictures even more the <unk>
As I once said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had started to <unk> she was just stopped to realize that I knew it even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his own face, you couldn't afford to <unk> the images in one photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up his photos he shared something about his history with us.
A few colleagues in his husband found the photographs in a fire station, between a pretty far of where they used to be his house, but his colleagues would get it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go into the water while <unk> <unk>
His small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
It took a week to find his whole family and knowing that everyone had survived.
The day I gave him his photographs his younger son <unk>
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could get to -- something that he could go back to -- something that I could look at, something I could remember the past day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, and there were hundreds of them helped us clean in the hand of <unk> photographs of the great <unk> -- the vast majority came to the hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families hundreds of <unk> photos and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than 1,000 dollars and materials, most of them on ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, somebody loved.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would use but the first thing we would look for.
So about this is the project, of restore small pieces of humanity, of giving back to somebody with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, it is a huge difference in the life of the person who are <unk>
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them to something bigger, back something, using their talent to something that are not going to be thin skin models.
To finish this email -- I would like to read this email that I sent over the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and stories shown in the imagery.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering a little bit about a baby, <unk> because a picture of my family, my grandmother, my mother, and my newly <unk> daughter hangs off our wall.
In the entire world, in all of our basic needs, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this photo of a bullet going through an exhibition in an exhibition of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion frames a second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can make videos in the slow motion of light.
And with that we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see inside of the body without using X-rays, and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and switch on and <unk> it in a second <unk> or a number of <unk> to create a pile of photons from just a millimeter wide size.
And that package of photons -- that <unk> traveling at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and <unk> on this bottle, how do you get these photons into this <unk>
What is the thing about the light in <unk>
Now, this whole thing --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light on motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --   -- a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a array of photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes down to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally arrive at the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air it bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the top bottle, you see it at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we make it run the same distance and see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think would take us to see that film?
One day?
It would be a very boring film, of a slow <unk>
And what about <unk> nature.
You can see the waves coming out of the table, the tomato wall and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at one more time, you realize that, as the light is <unk> in the <unk> continues to <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is <unk> and the light goes back and it comes back after several <unk>
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruits is grown without having to get it away.
Why do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture to low exposure, it comes into a very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> exhibition -- so I just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons -- millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data in crude and <unk> very interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible themselves.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could shine a little bit of light on the door. You get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and you go down to the camera.
And where we could extract those multiple light sets of light.
It's not science fiction. We have built.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a dummy and you get the light on the door.
And after the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera -- but interestingly, at some slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good temporary resolution and can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also even the hidden objects, but we don't know what about it is about what about a distance.
When you project a laser you can record a photo in a raw, which, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, tens of images, and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our rebuilding
We have things to explore before we pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could make cars that are <unk> collisions with what is around the curve, and so on.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at the light that's reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of seeing the inside of the body by using <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a scientists for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new form of visualization to solve the problems of community health in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, turned science science and an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all of the <unk> data that we collected every time is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see that we can be able to be seen.
We create a new form of computational photography, slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves, you remember the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk>
But here is something that is fun.
If we look at the waves under the <unk> these are moving away from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we're recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects. At Einstein would have loved this image.
The order in which events occur in the world is sometimes <unk>
<unk> the corresponding of the space of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can save your life, and it gives you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, you get it to <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this moment to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people would come up in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989. So imagine if all of these people gathering that they would go for a change, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who from entering a mobile here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile hand, <unk>
<unk> A Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a mobile phone.
But today I'm going to talk about my mobile phone, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission in 2006, a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every single telephone company, every single community provider has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your Internet <unk>
And all over Europe, people planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the telephone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people that came out to the streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police in East Germany.
And I also asked myself if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which for favor of all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to the question, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of the end, I agree.
It would send me the demand and they send me the information that I would do.
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> -- 30 pieces of information.
I first saw it, and I said, well, it's an enormous file, OK.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There is six months of my life in this file.
It was a bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what is the retention of data.
So next to <unk> <unk> and Open it looked at it City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom in and zooming in, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see what I'm going to see on the train to <unk> and what often I call it the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little bit of fear.
But it's not only about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we're talking a couple times.
Then they call me some friends and they call them a few of them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one another, and we ended up with this great communications network.
You can see how their people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see this whole thing.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who's talking to whom, who sent an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who participated in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who were the leaders, it would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall of the Berlin might never have happened.
And as a result, not the fall of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible within and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives, and they want to be <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they turn home to your friends that privacy is a 21st century value and not yet fashion.
When you go home, you know, your representative of your representative and the lab agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me into the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions -- <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why it turns out all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, though they are.
Just by accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of you to present them.
It feels bad for me, because at some point in life, you have to be disabled.
Let's go for a ride.
Christmas Christmas -- are in the mall, you drive in search of parking lot, and what do you see?
16 places to disabled them.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would gain the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> <unk> woman, disabled and living in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do that.
I'm from Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always love that my neighborhood and my disease had the same initial ones.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York City.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe at the shouldn't.
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters. If my three sisters.
If my three older sisters went to the public school, my parents <unk> to the school system, and it was <unk> that I was also out of it, and if we didn't take all the last note -- we all had my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five, putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another solution that I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me so that you can get it out.
The <unk> that I carry inside it was very strong.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> which has received many <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 degrees and still being all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we were not <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think about using <unk> to the <unk> like campaign.
The people I grew up, they didn't have problems with my faith.
However, it seemed like <unk> a lot of hunger on the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating them, so you know, the dawn of dawn at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the way to Palestine -- we're going to take care of <unk>
On the summer holidays so often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back, I was going to put me on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before we do yoga it was a comedian of <unk> who couldn't stand up <unk>
And now I can focus on the head.
My parents would ask this idea that I could do anything, that any dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the Legacy Hospital was <unk>
I went to college with positive discrimination and I got a grant to the <unk> University of the State State of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> <unk> of the theater.
I was all <unk>
I made all the tasks of the least smart, and I took the maximum note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> <unk> in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started shouting at the four <unk> The end will have a <unk>
I have paralysis <unk>
At the end of the end of the end, <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm at the end of my <unk>
I didn't get the role.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater, crying crying as if someone would have killed my cat, to ask me why and she told me that because they thought I could not make the venture scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the risk, you can't do it either.
It was a piece of paper that he had literally been born and gave a actor without cerebral <unk>
College was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors for disabled actors for disabled people.
At graduation, I went home, and my first tour <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream was done.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend in a <unk>
Instead, it was there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> directors don't <unk> actors -- not white, with disability.
It just transferred to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, it took the famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and I never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell at high speed on the <unk> New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral palsy, with a <unk>
I worked in <unk> all the United States, and also in Arabic, in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little stupid rumor that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> in New York City, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight the challenge of stigma for disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program by wire, it has Keith <unk>
I walked down as if I went to a graduate dance, I went back to a study and they sat me on a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, "You can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the desktop desk to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when he ended the interview, I was <unk>
At the end I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was like <unk> full-time and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and no child or older.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
They were playing videos on the comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite -- <unk> <unk>
What disease does we have?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> you can't make somebody in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that they don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
But I have to have grown up with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create most positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there would have more positive images -- that's going to be less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe no.
We probably need all the society to teach our children.
My journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to meet the red carpet of the <unk> Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world is <unk>
I was <unk> in terms of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugees -- the tiniest part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me in alive, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small town.
I don't know their name, but I know her story.
It lives in a small South African town.
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and the edge of <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the <unk> of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no work, no perspectives of future.
He just lived in a tent, in the city outside <unk>
So after maybe a year ago, nothing.
One day he was about a gentleman who offers him to take it back to dinner, and after dinner, you <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives it a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
They presented to a young man.
Finally, it was home.
It starts a new life.
It has an objective of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That child from that little village with dreams of the great city was the terrorist bomber and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> an terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a young village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
He was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that got it out of what we call the <unk> period.
And their story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young city urban urban <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the <unk> promise of city is the opportunity for jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of the five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in our cities in our cities, if they don't give them any opportunities for the history of <unk> the door to terror, to violence -- to be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people is <unk>
70 percent don't work, they don't go to school.
They don't do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, "What if he had never gone?
And if I had been forced to be forced to be on that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a juvenile leaders in a business audience.
<unk> about 90 juvenile leaders, <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> it was <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a graduate student, <unk> frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the greatest obstacle to the point B is the street.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely made the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
They started <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story different.
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's <unk> and I believe that business spirit may be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for life.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business enterprise.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic to be sent from plastic from <unk>
If you give somebody, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard weather of <unk>
And the delivery of flowers for wedding create gardens in the houses, and the companies in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where the families, young people, can go together, and, like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he is not <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their history, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
They encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, which might be <unk> of the change.
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions to some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So I will inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to deal with the development and put it into their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, and the support that they need to go from conception to the creation, and create the <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create social impact.
Mohamed not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Peace Park, which is how it calls it when it's created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is, to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, and they eat their frugal innovation, and they have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> which <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area called the north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was making the sheets that were <unk> like a <unk> and not the way it was going to be <unk> we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful lake.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four feet with heart hearts -- <unk> balls of aluminum and <unk> <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they thought they thought that was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was a little bit like this.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how they <unk> or where do you <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our junk -- of 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet you with the individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work does.
What do you feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked into his dorm trucks and I interviewed people in office and facilities all over the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go more <unk>
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just run into the trucks. I was <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong to be <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still going to get the weight of carrying their body tons of garbage all the weeks.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of Office <unk> the garbage collection is one of the most dangerous corners of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and moving in the traffic all day and pass it all around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that they often fall out of the truck.
I also learned about the relentless of trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that garbage is like a force of nature itself.
You never stop coming.
It's also like a breathing way or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I think the <unk> of waste is the most important workforce on the city streets for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective way every day, this starts to get rid of their containers and their dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
Since decades, we had controlled for decades, and centuries they come from and they start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old stuff, we don't have space for what the economics engines begin to fail when it's endangered as well.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just point out the relationship.
And then it's what I call our daily average speed necessary.
I mean, just at the speed of what we used to go used at <unk>
We don't usually get rid of us, and we don't have to be able to discover or we get to our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a job force on the other side that will be aware of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the garbage collection that might help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every single day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
You know when they were <unk>
And their work allows us to do ours.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that they keep us except for ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after the 11th of 2001 I heard the <unk> of a wastewater collection truck on the street, he grabbed my little son, and I went downstairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper like I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank him that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started looking at the garbage collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species, we have a species to include and have on account all costs, even the very real human cost of the labor.
The city waste that we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of your days and their lives, the next few that you see someone whose job is to clean the trash of you, let me give you a moment to <unk>
Let's get a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our communal life, forming the environment of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center in the capital of the Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example, my team and I, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are a lot of in the city we realized that there are three important aspects for <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, its kind of thing has nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a worthwhile for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted to the old market that is this open air structure where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern <unk> of several stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge is presented to you the site that is located in a very much area of a lot of the city, where a lot of the buildings we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing that we did was to create a connection between these two streets, linking all the inputs from the building.
And it spreads out to an <unk> <unk> which creates a space to open the air in the building that was <unk> by its own form, the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that supports the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of <unk>
They have properties of the fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We are building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
And with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall because at the end of the mall there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got certain savings in the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short every day.
So we got a great advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of gathering and bars that would create this <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which is collecting water for the courts.
It's waiting for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest that I ever have designed -- I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I set special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure of 1,000 years of <unk> that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> gates connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was we expand the streets, and we created 12 early blocks of the size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some particular points in relation to the idea of <unk> gates with straight lines, and this change the initial model.
And the last operation was thinking about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, like an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So let's make a scheme that makes sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European <unk> and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that make a greater density at the upper levels and a lower density at the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite field of the project is almost like giving the community to the space that was occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, you can upload and <unk> and make such activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, they have a common approach in the design process.
And in addition, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people changes the communities and local economies at the same pace that the buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that the relationship between the community and the environment and they have to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of very bright hair, and a little bit of <unk> <unk> and it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I was a time after my school. It was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took the table of my teacher to the <unk>
And then, I did.
I have the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few these.
All of the Like --  And I signed up with the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put them all rows of <unk> and I just line up a row in a row by just being there, because I am."
I'm still surprising to what I did.
I don't understand how the whole idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I was important.
I don't understand why I never care about.
It's that it was all obvious <unk>
I would never tell me.
But above all, I was struck by the reason why I thought this little girl was so good for <unk>
Do the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies have jealousy.
Also, <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that was going to be <unk> or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels is like the lab in which they study <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no matter that if there was no literature.
I didn't have to have <unk> the <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
It wasn't Shakespeare.
<unk> the lists of reading the high school lists because we would be missing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> or <unk> We were <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of jealousy, most of them have all of them.
This year is a hundred years ago that his <unk> work, "In search of the time -- <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> mine, mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details of it, right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious like the jealousy, that the jealousy, that is reduced to the person, their desire, to their <unk> are a well-known narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being the time storytellers and audience, we know exactly what any details of the <unk> to <unk> the knife is it?
The <unk> make all Hindu novelists and that is something that I knew I understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts saying to yourself, that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh silence that <unk> detects in his lover, he adds it to his collection of torture in his private chamber.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion, you have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the bright loads of hair and the cute little bit of <unk>
The <unk> came out of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good language <unk> with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of soon listen to the gates and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know that you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the performance of an old text or to look at a <unk>
He says, "It's these scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem to be <unk> but in your <unk> they are looking for knowledge, looking for the truth, a really painful truth in fact, to what I was going to do -- <unk> the more painful, the better the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these were the <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, it causes us a range of much more profound feelings and vital than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There is some other emotion, we got our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity that teaches us.
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young young young man who was used to the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud says there was something weird in that guy who didn't notice what his wife was.
So she was <unk> everyone knew it.
The poor creature was <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing it, <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or does not accidentally laugh with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look at the intensity but not accurately.
In fact, the most intensely <unk> we are, we more we became the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent acts of <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for eight years now, <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about news.
A woman from Michigan years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since the one that would be sent as horrible messages to itself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to meet the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. And I have to confess that when or this, reacted with <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How big -- even though <unk> Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to make our minds <unk> and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in an instant.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want to want what you have to take on your own and <unk> of what you once <unk> and it's under the ground -- he is under the ground -- it takes your <unk> cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as much as I want to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us the <unk> I'm not sure.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> Street Street and ask by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about the curse at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I always had <unk> <unk> <unk> the chief face of <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, it needs <unk> <unk>
Oh, I was so <unk>
<unk> needs your help, but we get it out and forth with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> it comes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And it tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to raise your hands.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> He was taken in the story, and he was very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
We seem to treat <unk> like an geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowing that idea to be he <unk>
Could it be so simple?
What if <unk> are really an issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to think about the excellence of the other.
We can match it with it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that happens, let's remember that we have the fiction fiction <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> the scary thing Tom <unk> the <unk> <unk> the very Marcel Proust of it.
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the cover of the Apollo <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
And the Apollo program was the greatest mobilization.
To get to the moon NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked about 400,000 businesses, universities and universities and government agencies.
They died, including <unk> of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> I walked over his surface, of which you saw in the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 percent later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common lives.
Why do I mean, the cynics answer is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But my own words from Kennedy at University of Rice <unk> gives us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why does it be <unk>
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And they could also ask, why will scale the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West about this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do that.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of climate projects.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane, the penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and they eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a candle ship, but in 1969, the <unk> crew 10 flew to 40,000 miles per hour.
From the 1970s, no human being turned to the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than a crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we think that technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seems to have been <unk>
I remember the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the escape escape from the rocket <unk>
I knew that this was the last mission to <unk> but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that really happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard that all the time.
We've heard it for the two days here, at TED.
It looks like the technologists had found us and enriched with trivial, and they have enriched toys, and things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up the selling <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't understand the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> who have created less ambitious companies than the age of the years that you get in, and you know, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that the venture capitalist. They offer entrepreneurs who give entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of the risk caused that the creation of ideas will cause the creation of ideas by <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worry about the risk, they were small investment investments, the tiny investment of the minute that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies like energy, which they need a massive capital and which development is in the long term. They don't have invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have any commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and very profound.
Sometimes, we chose to do not solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you were to <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We're not going to go to Mars because everyone thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption is about renewable energy sources, like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
<unk> and natural gas is cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want the alternative energy sources that you can supply on the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on which policies and international treaties -- the development of an <unk> energy development, a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we'll see an energy energy policy or international treaties that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technological, they don't be.
We know for the time that famines are a result of failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like the harvest or the systems for the storage and power of food, but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
President Nixon declared the war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many different types of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective and viable.
The difficult problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have been <unk> political leaders, and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it does with those criteria.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like John Kennedy is not a politician like John Kennedy that <unk> hard and dangerous, and there is no science of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to start with <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
It's so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a very large decline of trust, it's a very widespread subject.
The second is a <unk> we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think about trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to thinking that there may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that could have risen in others.
I don't have it.
But I can look at the surveys of opinion, and surveys of opinion are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there's no evidence of that.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years now, are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway over.
But is this evidence enough?
What surveys of opinion are, of course, opinion.
What else can you say?
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people play when they make certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if anybody asked you, <unk> on the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the masters of <unk>
You would probably ask by asking, "What for?"
And that would be a very embarrassing response.
And you could say, when you said your question, "Well, I trust some of you in a few other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to <unk> confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a particular guy from the official or a guy who is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, say that I trust a certain elementary school I know to give you the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my closest friend to keep a conversation, but no, perhaps, to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all of that knowledge when we think about trust in a <unk>
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real trust, the real trust, because they are trying to <unk> good judgment to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal that I was <unk>
I think I would have more confidence in what it's <unk> but not what it isn't.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who were sending their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think about them, I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
You're going to be deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say that, he says, yes, OK, that means that what it matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is this is about making a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that one person is <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible we could not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest and honest ones, but they don't mean in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that you will take your own <unk>
And I'm very happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still have no <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> and <unk>
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we tried to build accountability systems, for all kinds of <unk> professionals, and so forth, that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes more time to do the <unk> <unk> who will go <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we would argue that the accountability system is destined to ensure the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
Let's get it all that, for the goal.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different, if you think about being worthy of a trust, and we give them to the people that are safe and if we need to determine whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> which doesn't do <unk>
Third, the task.
So let's take the task to rebuild the trust, it puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
Can we rebuild a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve the confidence.
But trust, ultimately is the signature because we give them the <unk> other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the basis for enough for you to trust you.
You've got to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all the people, all the time.
But you also have to give us some evidence that you are worthy of confidence.
How do you do that?
That is done every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
And the store where I buy my socks on -- he says I can <unk> it without giving us <unk>
I take them and get the money back and get them through the color I want.
That's great. I trust them, because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good test that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I believe that what we're pointing is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how another person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world, and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone more and more and more, at the point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a glass, <unk> and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
So I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes back into the digital space, so that when the strong skin against the screen transfers their physical body into the pixel inside.
Designers can be able to prescribe their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But the two hands remain outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the entire hands?
In the division of Science <unk> at Microsoft, with my mentor who <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital field of work.
You know, a transparent bombsight with cameras to the depth of depth to detect the fingers and the face, you can now raise the hands of the keyboard, get into 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight <unk> or words with the virtual touch sensor that there's the bottom of each floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
And in these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make the digital information come toward us?
We had a lot of us ever bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system gets the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make it be physicists so we can <unk> and <unk>
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my tutor -- Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, this only physical pixel together.
This imam <unk> it behaves like a 3D pixel in the space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
We <unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of magnetic levitation and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, the object, the object, we release it from the restrictions of time and space, what you mean by saying that human movements can be <unk> and it will go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and distance and the famous shot by Michael Jordan, you can reproduce as a physics of the times you want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike monitors or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel. It's very powerful.
But what is most fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical experiences.
You see, the digital information is not just going to show us something but to start acting directly about us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to care about our world.
We started talking about a barrier, but if you take that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was pleased to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to go to a school for athletes with all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they believe that there was only an immediate path toward <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if I work or not.
But my dream was to be an African opera singer teach me.
This was me, on my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult would tell the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends, I was told, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> for the rest of my life a second class happiness would be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted <unk> Okay.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> I arrived in the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is the Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "It's so different, and so much better than it was.
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap and to reset the relationship with my parents.
And I meet a new culture with a new culture also turned to my habit of reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, the first map of this map seemed to me from place because this is what students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research camps like comparative religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if a comparative read worked for research, why don't we do it also in life as well.
So I started reading books.
You can be <unk> <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> by David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual development.
For Buddha, it's all <unk> lust, fear and the duty of <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- instead of getting lost in the translation, I found that you can make a lot of it.
For example, it is through the translation of the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese.
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be going back or powerless ever.
Having a dream dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that comes to dreams, where the passion, where it comes to happiness.
Until an <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, which today I'm here, happy, living again and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley.
She was a 17-year-old woman named <unk>
Alex came to the first session using jeans and a letter <unk> threw himself on the couch of my office took off my shoes and told me that he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My fellow class had a <unk> like the first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the stories of <unk> that Alex <unk> to the <unk> became easy to just move the head while you get the solution.
<unk> is the new <unk> he said Alex, and so I would see she was right.
You start to work later, they went home later, she has kids later, to death later.
To <unk> like Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after, my <unk> <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's coming out of these guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And so my <unk> he said, "No no, but maybe you get to the next one.
Also, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel a head after what was <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and I had real consequences not just for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody gets to adulthood without passing the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk>
Oh, yeah? They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my view. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years.
This means that eight of each 10 and experiences and moments and moments that they have to shape their life will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> of more than 40, I don't panic.
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that they <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or are coming out with their partner to the 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and the last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> what it means if there's something that you want to change ourselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time of life, and we know that female fertility comes to their top 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their daily life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called an adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the time of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence <unk>
<unk> <unk> names <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
<unk> <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head and say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and ambition and this is absolutely nothing.
And then every day, very interesting as you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know something like this: "I know that my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship to not matters. It's just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, the music turned the music and they all started sitting.
I didn't want to be the only one I'm standing, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he was <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of <unk> but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge amount of pressure, and so many of you will start a career.
So many of these things are not <unk> and there is research that you start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying cars into red cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want to do now.
You realize you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give her a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I, sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because she was, in his own words, having a identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but you still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper to live with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult <unk> their previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then it would wake up, and she said, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost every hour.
He had just bought a new book to <unk> and I had spent the entire morning with his many <unk> but then he was seeing the empty space that follows after words "In case of the <unk> please call <unk>
He was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be to me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I give me <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in while he was sitting in the <unk>
So for the next few weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was <unk> of that crisis of identity and <unk> capital of identity.
<unk> capital -- I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital of identity generates identity capital.
So now it's time for that work of the other side of the country, the <unk> of that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> the exploration, I am <unk> the exploration that I should not tell -- which, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and make them count.
Secondly, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds of who you know what you know how you think, how you talk, and where work.
That new piece of capital that new person who comes out almost always comes from the outside of their closest circle.
The new things come from what they call weak bonds of their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the way we get to this group.
Half of the <unk> jobs will never be <unk> then knowing the chief of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma would soon give their family when they have a mate and shape their own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think that 30 is better age to sit in mind than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live in now or let you tell you now when everyone on Facebook, they start walking toward <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing that will work or kill time with anyone who will get them to you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of the quarter of a cousin who worked at an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped me get a job there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, who lived in.
Now, five years later, it's a special <unk> special in museums.
This married man who chose consciously <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send a letter that said, "Now the connections of contacts contacts are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like planes coming out of Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight light on its trajectory is a difference between landing in Alaska or <unk>
Likewise, at the same way, 21 or 25 and even the <unk> a good deal -- a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here is my idea worthy of spreading all the people who have heard of.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I have the privilege of saying to <unk> as Emma every day: <unk> aren't the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity capital -- using their weak bonds pick your family into your family.
Don't you define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job <unk> for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City, in New York City.
And like any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
I give you tasks.
When I work back, I will increase grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. wasn't the only difference between my best and my greatest students.
Some of the people who had a better performance had no I.Q. I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids were not going to be doing that well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, safe, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts aren't impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for time enough.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a psychological perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure it in a better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of scenarios -- and in every study my question was, who is success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we're trying to predict what they were going to do to the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children were doing as far as possible in the competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in really difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school and the <unk> who will be the most effective thing to improve the learning results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, which of these sellers are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all these very different contexts, arose a feature like an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, physical health, and not I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> passion and resilience to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not at the same time.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools in Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students who did my questionnaires of determination and then waited for more than a year to see those who were <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater likely to get them out, even when they had them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the evidence -- even the security results that felt children when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or at the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most striking thing about determination is how little we know about the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you development determination in children?
What do I have to do to teach children a robust ethical ethic.
How do I keep motivated for the long <unk>
The more honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the commonly is not related or is even related to women's <unk>
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go ahead.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to be <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to <unk> to begin everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my wildest memories is my mother <unk> beauty, the shape and the figure of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It looks like the Great Wall of China.
Over the last few years, I've been asking me if I can break down this <unk> so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese can be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese academic scholar -- 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read from traffic <unk> menus <unk> understanding the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how this method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as well as it can be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both sides, like if I were screaming so much, <unk> -- this symbol of reality is <unk> in the form of the called, but I like to believe it is the other way that it works.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates from a <unk> in the old West.
I call sweeping to these eight characters.
They are building blocks so they believe a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two is a company, three are crowd.
If you stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> just like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  -- from remember, because a loudspeaker tree is pretty idiot.
Remember fire?
Two together, it's very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the light moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door, put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> has someone at home?
This person is coming out of a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've been through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as a Chinese <unk>
So after the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the East <unk>
This is a <unk> sun with the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two stacked mountains one on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their politicians beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is an exit.
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a brilliant excuse to use a brilliant dress.
But when you see that film, so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children into a kind of industrial complex computer computer show.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later, later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal guy and a young guy who had a metal who was dressed in their <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a huge difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the <unk> magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the armies used by the <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing of the <unk> magician is that the most skilled characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I did see "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a child as well.
Two years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of surveillance I had <unk>  So he slid in the room and she was so slid in the room and he was struck as a mother of his leg, and he didn't think he understood what he was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what a <unk>
Would you be value, perseverance and <unk>
I should have a sense that Luke one military to <unk> the government?
This is the <unk> of <unk>
How does it make Dorothy her film?
Are you doing good <unk> with everyone and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up with it, right? And not a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much capital force, the force in the movies for our kids, and so little about the way of brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I've not read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know for experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first kiss. I would really expect the credits to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are a lot of exceptions, and to stand at the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, the boys, are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal work to teach girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies like war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is continuing in classic and classic every one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raising a child.
As far as many of you are thinking, this year finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these films is happening the test test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't gotten roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comics, and in the <unk> '80s, I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character who has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women speak each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are more besides the guy who so much like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality movie.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- a consensus idea of what's a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> is not the test of <unk>
And I don't think <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film is happening in a embassy where men and women are hidden during the police crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, "Do you get to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, from the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe that they have actors in them.
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women who have chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number than this which is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that government had done.
This is what it would say.
In the United States, one in five women say it's been sexually removed once in his life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for children have something to do with that.
I don't think music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is there is a lot of sex <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they not get to <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very startling statistical statistic and we want to take it out.
We have tools like we have tools like <unk> <unk> and we hope that I have to ask you, but I have to ask, "Is it going to tell you -- yeah, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their power out.
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our males a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter who was his favorite favorite character for "Star "Star "Star <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they are experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want you less stories about the ones that tell me about my <unk> Go and struggle with and more stories where you see his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked was to look at sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was reminded by <unk>
I started looking at shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of almost 3,000 miles of the length of the <unk>
My sea biscuits had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, in the naked view, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and <unk> using <unk> <unk> suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape of <unk> by building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used satellite data to find an ancient <unk> city, called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt of Egypt for more than 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because on the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of ancient art.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles, but somewhere within this enormous <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it's about <unk> per mile per mile.
Before, President <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved on to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find out the randomness, it would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the <unk> eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So, we used to use NASA from NASA to make a map of place with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area that looks inside the circle here, which we thought might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians with Egyptians doing <unk> they can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation for granted.
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer of humans, we found a dense layer of objects of ceramics.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundred years to date out of the Ottoman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what proves there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to be not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used on the jewelry, of the Ottoman Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that goes back in the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a railroad jewelry shop that proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but let's take it to the place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire -- it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago:
<unk> knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So as it looks, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually actually started in 1984 <unk> in a missing city, not for a lot of time and found from the top.
It certainly puts the pursuit of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the <unk> door.
I'd like to pay you to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> obese group.
They are competing in a race of bicycles and go back to their front door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes flying around everywhere, wheels that go on on the wheels that they end up in <unk> places -- the edge of the door, the door.
<unk> in the hallway or what there is to the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light, and the light is shining over the <unk> of <unk>
He's waving with the hand.
It was from his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that talks about.
You can feel your blue <unk> blue running on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and trained their living room.
In the room, and making maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
He is with time dancing on his center <unk> singing <unk> <unk> One more <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow brick path and from the oven coming to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of hands, jumping up.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes place in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages of different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers and look at them just once.
<unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
We took full poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I asked her, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition says they have normal memory.
"We were trained to perform these <unk> acts of memory using some old old techniques invented a half a half years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used to <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that <unk> <unk> used to memorize books.
And my reaction was, "Well, how do you not heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English guy, although a little bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me.
Or do you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem with <unk> is awesome.
Somebody was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk>
We spent one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And by coming back, a number of treaties on memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as it might look like today.
A long time, people will invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed.
We have changed the <unk> and I would argue that they have changed also change as well.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people on this idea of an <unk> memory memory and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's really not that <unk> there is a job like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers at London invited a group of memory champions into the lab.
They wanted to know: Will it have brains in some form of structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
Are they more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a standard test battery and the answer was actually no.
There was yet a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in a magnetic <unk> <unk> your brains while <unk> numbers, faces and shapes of candy in the <unk> they found that in memory or <unk> parts of the brain, different from others.
They were actually <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> competitive is managing as an armed race in where each year comes up with somebody with a new way to remember more things, and then the rest of competitors must have a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of Christmas cards that he's about to stand up in an hour, using a technique that he invented and only he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And while there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end, they reduced to a single concept that psychologists call <unk>
This is illustrates with a elegant paradox like the <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I'm going to tell two people who remember the same word. I tell you to you, "Well, there's a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, "Do you notice that there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them, "Did that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> what would you say?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word as the person who was told that his work is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it doesn't really mean for you. It has no relationship to you.
All the other memories you dance on their head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They did good when they come home to work.
You probably had some <unk>
And when I was looking at that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most successful techniques to do this dates back two years ago in <unk> <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired as a entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, you didn't get a great party, and you didn't get a <unk>
He stood up, he <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and as soon as the <unk> room was <unk>
Tell everyone.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies of <unk>
No one could tell who I was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So they couldn't get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
You know, he was standing out of a single survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where she had been sitting every single time.
I took the family of the <unk> hand, where they were their loved ones between the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions or instructions for the word of your colleagues, we have visual memory and spatial memory.
If you ask them to tell you, the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to get it very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you ask them to say who I was sitting on the horse ordered in your <unk> you would be able to <unk>
The idea of memory palazzo is to create this building with the eyes of their mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it out of memory, the same way that would have done it, if they were invited to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that you're on the door of your home.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous image, crazy and <unk> to help us remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then it goes in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year and have some friends to help you remember it.
So this is how <unk> <unk> <unk> the word for the word -- it doesn't be confused but <unk>
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek Greek that means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first would be like the first place in your memory issue.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something unique about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking exams.
I'm a journalist, and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put me in his place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient school dropout bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was kind of fun.
I would never have expected you to get it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just training the memory.
What it really is about doing is to improve more and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was pretty much like this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses of tape with tape leaves only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that had been covered in a year before, and I had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice power to memorize narratives and phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just tricks.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> from the memory or to memorize <unk> <unk> to profit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
It <unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not really <unk>
They work because they make it <unk>
It would be sort of a kind of deep processing species, a kind of complete attention that most of them are not going to be sitting there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave with you today -- is what I was looking at -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short existence is in the <unk> or <unk> not by paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking to our side, we are so <unk> that we don't even bother to process in <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex topic, so we would just take a place called New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, which I was six years old, and I lived there at home in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all the time I looked at the television, so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everybody else, and every time I <unk> and I went back into a towel -- all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> empty and hated it.
I took that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
Right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, and that is not the division of math, but of those connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that we have.
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines it in ways we don't even notice them.
It makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they ask you, think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it in a building that we built a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that they use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they want to use ways that you know they're going to work.
So we find buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Library -- which was in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, he's got this <unk> it has this <unk> <unk> columns -- which <unk> <unk> what they <unk> what it is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the values of ownership the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come up, read and sharing.
So what is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of these so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions to the forms of life today.
We got it and we gave them so much and we gave them so much of the people.
And all of black, this is <unk> you believe that we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to the other side of the <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> And so we started trying to swing the <unk> back and over and over and over and over again, so we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> from the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, small-scale scale.
It's really hard.
So we are approaching the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
He <unk> the next one in the other direction.
We took those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and added bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time on commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> or <unk> or <unk>
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreated memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the symbols -- we now have new design techniques now we have to have new design techniques -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> some ways that were attached to other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You are totally <unk>
Normally the next <unk> again in opposite direction.
But then something else happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building fundamentally changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical academic and public and public and public and public and public and public and public in general, were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a half and a half and the building.
So all of a sudden, everyone wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star architect star.
But what is it possible that these wild forms, and how do you be able to become ubiquitous across the world?
And it came out, because the media was <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the top mayors in the world.
So everyone believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennials with other star architects.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, it actually started to go through all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption as well.
Think of it, for example, how they eat architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked the next village to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> you can take a boat, you can be <unk>
<unk> <unk> You can see on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because the architecture is moving so quickly.
It doesn't really look at a lot of time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings, or 100 more buildings, before I know if that he designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement, but 20 years old.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen. Because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of steel or <unk> and the <unk> and the media revolution.
My theory is that when it applies to the <unk> media, it starts to swing faster and faster, and to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you are the audience.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building was already part of the community, and like drawings looked exactly at the end, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being in the social media, because these are not just images of a building, because these are the images that you did from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory and in charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building is built today, first of the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of technology, about what it can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can bring the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library may be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer these mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and <unk> and complicated, and one is not a <unk> public who doesn't take something that has no before.
The architects can listen, and you don't get confused by architecture.
That means that the <unk> of one form to another, of one movement is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find <unk> solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historic brick of red brick based on ideas of what a <unk>
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the shapes that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings are attached to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, you can also serve for a sport or for <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream on the East <unk> of New York City, and a half million dollars of the community came around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because it doesn't matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more intelligent, more friendly buildings.
We've been waiting for you all to want.
Finally, we're not opposite in <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot in play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they make it way to the more unequal spaces, local libraries -- the homes where we form our children, and the walk of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it really cool a typical year of children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is <unk>
She really loves his reflection.
He <unk> and <unk> and he gives themselves those <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And I was thinking, "When were to do this?
How do we suddenly be happy with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, it just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week at school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, despite the fact that his mom says it all the time -- every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Among what his mom tells you and what his friends, or classmates say, you don't know who I believe.
So a video of her himself, publishes it on YouTube, and begs other who please stop a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal <unk> teenager who gets these answers in one of the stages of their most vulnerable life stages.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never ends.
Never before we have been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's simply no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, that we are always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There's no divide between a online living and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is manipulated digitally.
What is the most intriguing thing about someone else's life in front of what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the type of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> is still dominating our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what young people do today.
But the boys are also immune to this.
Like the Los Angeles stars and the singers in <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we probably want our children to grow healthy and be individuals well <unk>
But in a <unk> culture, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of every other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and other ways they start to be hurt.
Six in 10 girls would rather do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and as a role to society and the business of working development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom. They are not interested in the classroom.
One in five are not going to be speaking at all the time during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the rainy season, if you don't think you see you good enough -- specifically if you don't believe you are thin, you're thin, <unk> a smaller note on the average of your fellow who are not concerned about that looks.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And it comes down regardless of what these young people actually are.
So to be quite clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you -- not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on his body is <unk> <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-worth are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy that they can take a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at most risk of depression.
And we think this is all because of this because of what they make more conservative decisions like consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early ages and no protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system, and our government costs them billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or don't have higher rates of <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview on one day where they don't feel safe in the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms -- the first is that we have to nurture trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and building their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs that are available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very shocked when I learned that a lot of a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, you know, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow not only a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas -- the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects of the starting points for anyone willing to provide an education on body self-worth that works.
One education is a <unk> but to deal with this problem requires each of us to take the reins in the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
Thank the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell the contribution from our politicians to <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as they see.
All of us can start doing it by taking responsibility for the type of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can put them into people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and businesses, to change truly our culture, so our children will grow up to the whole person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put the people that are really making the difference in a <unk>
It will make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that come out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never seen by being those who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are in mind?
Her <unk>
Her <unk>
Her <unk>
Her <unk> A <unk>
Could it be just the woman who's two seats. What would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, which would be told by not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a shorter belly feet.
What would it mean for her if we take care of it, what would it mean for the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is attached to us.
But let's make our children the truth.
And so the way you see you see is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
It impacts the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compare it to other people.
And we put together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year age of today, they become safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On five November 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Women's Defense <unk>
<unk> initially as innocent as innocent -- but being prisoner in the other <unk> in the company of others, they started planning to plan about 12 New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
Fortunately, those plans for the <unk> of an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the progression of 1993 on the World Trade Center couldn't escape them.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an <unk> engineer, with a <unk> <unk> Sunday school teacher among the two did all the possible for giving me a happy childhood me.
When I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, which very few, even most Muslims come to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, you don't need a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there are always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we have to use all the possible means so that everyone lived in like them.
A few months prior to arrest him and he sat with me and explained that in the last week, he and some friends, had been going to <unk> on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I was going to the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When my father touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on his shoulder and explained how to point at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he <unk> I gave the little orange light on the goal and, for surprising to all, especially mine, all the goal on flames.
My uncle became the others and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, that child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter, but just a few years later I understood what they thought about that funny.
Did you see it in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be condemned by putting a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground park of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood wasn't allowed to make a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was already time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always me the new face of the class often was <unk>
<unk> secret to my identity to avoid being the white but being the new of the <unk> silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't have social skills, to put <unk> <unk> and I was not prepared for the real world.
I was <unk> opera judge people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or your religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences they put to test my way to think, was during the presidential elections of 2000.
On a <unk> program I was involved in the National Democratic Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, because I had been a <unk> <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids that we had done, I was Jewish.
I took several days out of the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud of having been able to overcome the barrier that my whole life had been made to believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience turned fundamental in the development of my character.
My whole life was taught that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all the gay <unk> were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy toward the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people kind, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
By that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the interaction of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be the homosexual but I know what is being on trial for something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me being <unk> honest about my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation. They have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my mind <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that an Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she said to me something that conserving my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the eyes tired of somebody who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed it when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put on a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope someone, someday anyone who is trying to take violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I was fascinated by this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones, the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has provided in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism -- against these <unk> acts of the <unk> of my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all  Thank you all  Thank you.
At this moment there's a film that is projects in your minds.
It's an incredible film, incredible.
It's in 3D and it has sound <unk> that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has smell tastes and texture.
It feels your body your pain, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that projects before your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on the stream of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in place.
This film is your <unk> the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
<unk> is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of being human.
Every one of us is conscious.
We all have an inner film, you, you, you and you.
There is nothing to make you more directly.
At least, I know I have a free awareness.
I don't have certain that you are aware of.
<unk> is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of it, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the deepest phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we have to get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is an objective of science.
<unk> by nature, it's subjective to nature.
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we get that vision.
psychology was studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience, studying the brain, but no one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
It was like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger Crick -- they said, "My <unk> is the moment for science, the <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a 21st-century science.
We know that these brain areas are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain to me by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain to consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain do and what are they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
It wasn't <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why does it have an internal movie.
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of the emerging behaviors, how do we operate the <unk> how do they work, how are they <unk> how they are adapting and <unk> the living organisms -- all of these are questions about how it works.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain like a <unk> phenomenon, how to tell us how we are talking about, how we play <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior questions are between easy problems.
But the difficult problem is the question of why everything is accompanied by an out-of-body experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a heart of heart.
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that works for a long time, I was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we were going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful explanation, and we have been used to this -- the physics explains chemistry, explains chemistry, explains chemistry, explains biology, accounts for the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this schema.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other hand, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision from the world, but we don't even know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning of <unk> crazy before we have to deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such thing that is difficult for consciousness.
All the idea of the subjective movie movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what we need to do, is to explain the functions of mathematical functions, the behaviors of the brain, and this is studying everything that needs explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is critical.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time we have left, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I believe can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a brick bricks and space, time and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> them like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of nothing more basic.
On the contrary, you see the fundamental things, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, they found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental fundamental concepts -- space, time, mass laws of Newton. And he applied the basic laws of Newton. And he applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, mass aid, then <unk> then by a matter of logic -- we have to attach the list of the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly is not a matter of science, right?
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other concepts fundamental concepts -- space, time, the mass, the mass, the <unk>
We physicists sometimes say we want the fundamental laws that we can put them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what law is, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs -- the dogs -- even the microbes in Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think of my God, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can't slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have any element of a crude feeling -- some very early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, time and mass, and it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to be <unk> it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that we think about the physical process, is <unk> the consciousness of information.
Whenever there's information processing, there is consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
A very exciting thing is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this type of theory, and I developed it <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated in a system.
And it's not supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration, of information, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a half a half of information integration, the same quite significant, degree of consciousness -- quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, these particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a level of consciousness unlike zero.
They actually pose a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and philosophers and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that's underneath.
Like this explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire of the <unk>
From the view, the equations of physics can leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision, I think, the <unk> vision has the potential to promote our relationship to nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some may be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, so I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> is not so much the fact of consciousness, but their importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha in the <unk> movie.
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have a very serious ethical and serious ethical problems about the developmental ethic of intelligent computer systems and the ethical ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of <unk> to the planet.
So Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group, as the audience in a TED Talk, we have a collective consciousness, an internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the <unk> movies from each other.
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you need to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way toward a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the most difficult problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we will finally be able to find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal, one under education.
I went to school, I got married with my friends, I <unk> with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice but there's an obvious issue.
She hasn't gotten anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had a low profile in the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
So years later, I was in the second part of teaching the teaching in a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 of the studies, a guy raised the hand and said, "Hey, when to give your <unk>
And I said, "What would you say?
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about things like <unk> in school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this was this child with people with disability with disabled objects.
And we don't know it, and it's not about the boy, I mean, that's true for a lot of us.
For us, the disabled people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair -- and probably you are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they were lied to the disability.
Yes, we have sold the lie that disability is <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and live with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and doesn't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we have been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad deal.
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the little girl without your hands drawing with a tuned pen in the mouth.
You may have seen a child running on a carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we would give a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we have the disability to the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we could see them and think, "Well, by very bad that my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I have lost the number of times that I've been talking strange about it: expressing expressing that believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was excited about getting up the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are linked to people with disability in benefit from people without disabilities.
You're there so that you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
You get a few things.
But the things that we have is not the things that you might think.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was fascinated by the so-called social model of the disability, that tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society that we live in because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It does the things I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of its ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the commons.
They are simply using their bodies taking the best of their bodies taking their bodies up.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, when you share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says like a compliment.
And I know why it does.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold to the lie that disability is quite exceptional to us.
And honestly, they don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not going to be used for anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, not <unk> I'm younger than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea using a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over,  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to upload the phone battery on the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold to disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us life hard.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a range of steps has never done a <unk>
Never.   So on front of a television screen, I'm not going to do the <unk> for <unk> people.
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turning all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> not to be on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of the people with disability that we would be able to get away from the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 11 grade kid in Melbourne is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is an user <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What do we have to do <unk> reality and professional <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm going to just answer one of those questions, so please, please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for that, and people need to know: because augmented reality change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get the reality to <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see I see.
I will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would engage with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a man at 110 pounds -- we were trying to share it with all its being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
You know, some videos to show you what is using Google <unk> under the helmet, give you a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the modern technology <unk> is a submarine moving up to the surface but we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A bit of <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it's going to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have noticed that lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> by <unk> Mice -- Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more to the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, it's going to be your favorite <unk> and I've asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
It's a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get into the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which you probably have to know about it.
The Rift Valley has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why why with this video here.
Man: Oh, yeah.
No, no, no, no, I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man on a roller coaster for her life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you put a video from Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball at the bottom of the network?
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality <unk> when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to gain.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> on his field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radio radio <unk> and then on the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you're in front of you, you don't have to worry about to forget about a <unk>
It has to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the countryside and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose their <unk> and they are <unk>
If you lose parties to you as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How do you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera on every corner corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who is down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
The good equipment will know <unk>
You have the bad information <unk>
This is going to take the good equipment.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being just for nerds.
It will also be to <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
It would be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> to an open receiver -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight will tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> they don't get it, but the <unk> system will get you.
It will lead to the protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there is an open receptor.
Let's get the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, but the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass that lights and can change the race.
He <unk> he picks up the <unk> runs and <unk>
The public <unk> and the fans have followed the play from each angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the party.
I'm going to make a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too much to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality.
We're going to use it just as a bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of revenues a year.
But how much is this technology worth for a teacher in the classroom trying to show you a <unk> how bad it is from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how they are being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of kids to think more about space and science instead of <unk> and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality gets close.
The questions that we do, the choices we do and the challenges that we face, we face ourselves as always, for us.
Thank you.
I was <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was the country that was <unk> the southern end of the county in <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is the <unk> of their beautiful views.
Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, a head of building the bridge, said that "The bridge is pretty much for <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, more than 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, such that each of the concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water approximately 120 miles an hour.
The impact is breaking down bones, some of which would be given vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that don't normally get into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> of this suicide method will notice the <unk> death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel steel on the bridge.
This is where most people were before they get their life.
I can tell you about experience that once the person is on that boundary, and at the most dark, it's very difficult to bring you back back.
And I took this photo last year while this young man talked about a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we were successful that day on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
They would be able to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, too.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, officers and psychologists train the new official ones.
This is Jason <unk>
I met it on July 22 of Julius last year when you get a call of a suicide bomber sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, he looked at Jason by talking to a official Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and there were just flown down here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were just flown down here two times before New Jersey to try to mate from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, "You know, we'll never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came up with the <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind and intelligent guy in New Jersey had just taken her life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, I didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see what I was.
The parents in Jason was the <unk>
<unk> damage is affecting a lot of people.
I'm asking you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved a <unk>
What do you say?
What does it say?
In my experience, not only have to talk, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't you <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels like you probably don't know it.
You just stand there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask them the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing their life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and never come to <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19th of January of this year, and he wrote to me this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permit and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this week.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends that tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving back to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
It never came up there.
And I called the police in <unk> and they <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the Mike car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the evening of the day.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been before without having a true mental disease.
It should not be so easy to finish it.
My sentences are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck, this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go forward.
I'd like to introduce you to a man when I mean hope and value.
On March 11, I wrote to a radio call by a potential suicide bomber on the street sidewalk near the northern tower.
I got my bike. and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, crossed the <unk> and he stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
And in the course of the next time, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
And Kevin decided on his account that day back on that lane and give life another opportunity.
When Kevin came to it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What was it that he made me <unk> and gave me the hope and life another <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "It was <unk>
They stopped me talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the 11th events and you're one of the reasons that Kevin keeps with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
And Kevin is in order, as he said.
We give God for you.
I really do debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General General of San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is an <unk> father and an active member of the society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression with the hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, theft, the opportunity to meet it.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide caps around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand back three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I am sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those guys who have jumped from the bridge and lived and that can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one they leave on the fence -- they realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and each of us should be working on to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your interior you know what you are, and a question asks you, how do you bother that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way.
When I became a model I felt that I was finally able to get the dream that I had since a child.
My outside finally filled with my inner truth, with my inner me.
And so why I go over the afternoon, when I look at this photo later, when I look at this photo -- I think, <unk> you know, <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all gave us our families, our religion, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of the people around us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, many of my neighbors -- a lot of my friends, a lot of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> when I was born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always had this shirt on the head.
And my mom asked me, "Why don't you have that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that actually, it's a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never thought to share my story, not because I thought it will be what I'm bad, but because of how the world comes to those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you every day, I thank you every day.
I have a mom, Dad and a family just accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines who celebrated these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman came in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something was <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the head of a beauty of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the contest of <unk>
He told me that if I was <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> of <unk> and the aside.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of beauty of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was from queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when they went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. My mom.
I was hooked.
I said to my mother, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "Do you know that if you hit the U.S., you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was standing in Thailand at the age of 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand perform the most sophisticated <unk> surgeries and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before we changed the name and the gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the <unk> name, and the gender of gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity document means able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York and being a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman from New York City that <unk> was living his truth, but <unk> he finally turned to his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 November, we make a global testimony for the Day Day.
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people who were <unk> and he stood at the injustice.
These are Marsha and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep my truth living and only for me.
I want to do the best to help the other to live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> for one day no longer even more <unk> than any <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Right. <unk> -- first, thank you all my <unk>
My parents of support, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young people who have had young people who have <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't accept it, he took my mom and he said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes they work, others don't. It's just identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to birth, and what I try to do is put on the table of the table that sometimes that task is not block, and that should be a space that would allow people to live, and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and asking questions, and I hope you all are my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, people generally know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by education defending his rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, and the <unk> the National Geographic Prize, was very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome by his father, not for his mother.
On the neighborhood -- it gives their <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was getting a lot to have a child.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, the first child, it gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only stem mother -- but the daughter was just <unk> when it grows, he suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, he stays home and the school survived the siblings.
Until 12 years old, in a way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with his friends on the street, and he can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes into adolescence, when he comes to 13 years, you have to get off the house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of his house.
It's no longer a free person.
It turns into the so-called honor of his father and his brothers and her family, and if you were to <unk> that of that of that of course, honor, the could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this of the honor code is not only affecting the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of men's members from the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of her sisters and happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's one more norm of <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the choices of their father and mother and the <unk> the <unk> and even if they don't will.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man has to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
What happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then he gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same God's lesson to his children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter like this.
But when I was <unk> everyone was men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half years old, I was <unk> in my school.
So you might ask, why should I mention a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, is a great event for the child's life.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One of the school means that it has entered the world of the dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was <unk> the form of a Canadian pool, and I was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit down with me when my friends came to me.
<unk> to go to a different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to hate them in their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've taken all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for <unk>
I went to my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught them to the students to forget the lesson from the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, providing more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of the involvement of women in political, economic and social.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
Girls are banned at school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> girls <unk> and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have these people who kill and learn when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, he got up and raised the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, he offered her himself for the documentaries New York Times and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate the campaign and the nine of October 2012, 2012, a shot in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between the life and death, he was sitting in my ear, "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please do not <unk>
Let's get the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right way and God <unk>
These few words have a lot of bad words for me, and I didn't go back and ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe pains, and his head pains, because his facial Francisco was cut, I used to see a dark shadow.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to <unk> "I'm okay with my <unk> smile, and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to give me right. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights, and women, it's like any <unk>
It <unk> when it didn't end up.
You fight it with your brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's special in my <unk> that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't did.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the Google group from Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google data, but all the work that I talk about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get into a brain operation.
You're still being used or not?
If not be like that, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen different chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix with chemicals, and try to get them out to work with life.
I have saved me for little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> for what I decided to do, to try to get the telltale dose, that you really don't have a clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try with <unk> and I was shocked to see how small changes in the dramatically <unk> doses -- my <unk> my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I was tried dose and common chemicals for an early man, and I was surprised by looking at how I did my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met a number of guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out to be an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had on the front, and it just wasn't going on.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and about what they have to do, I've been better with men.
What I was trying to achieve.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my key point of reference to how I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were to <unk> it was new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are those who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind. It is to me, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to critical thinking, and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really, really sophisticated <unk> and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to get very quick these mental images, of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a cinema director would be able to use your imagination only to drive the world it has the way?
Or if a musician could get the music in your head?
There's amazing possibilities with this, like how creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups leading into neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, MRI imaging -- to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The column in the middle of the brain shows the brain scan of that same individual while you're going to see that same image.
The column on the right was <unk> the contents of the central column on the left.
This is repeating in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn brain waves into visual fields.
Let's go this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while <unk> their brains to create a great pool of brain reactions to the video sequences.
And then they showed them a new film with new images, new animals, and as long as it was <unk> a new <unk>
The computer using only brain brain information, <unk> to show what seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us down.
We're okay to do this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember that when you see an image and when you can imagine that same image, you can create the same <unk>
This is done with the <unk> brain scan systems available today, and their resolution was increased as a thousand times in the last years.
Now we need to increase resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you <unk>
There's a lot of techniques to do that.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't have to give that one.
A lot of them are proposing new <unk> techniques, even I am, even with the recent outcome of MRI -- we first need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> they only give small improvements in the resolution -- not increases by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: instead of larger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements -- like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort in MRI was to make magnets really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in the <unk> of ingenious and brilliant and brilliant solutions in coding <unk> and <unk> <unk> and FM receptors in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field, all the biblical patterns of magnetic field, then <unk> into the radio frequencies that are <unk>
So when we combine magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns we can dramatically increase the <unk> information that you can get in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split up on layers of our increasing knowledge structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of blood -- but the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity. This is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go on top of the language and communicate directly by <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the Alzheimer's cure and similar disease.
We have a few choices more than opening up this door.
Anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just about <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
And so she was probably going to be telling some person for the first time that he loves or tell someone who's pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have done in life.
We were all about a tough conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've experienced the experience of I've experienced and there is a universal thing.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quoting the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> like a <unk>
And I will be slope to the <unk> of my <unk> <unk> and I had <unk> my head for a little bit, I would usually ask me -- usually a child would say, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would have uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father said, <unk> the newspaper and mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I went inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would say something.
I should have that difficult conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time I was prepared -- and I was about to go into the female issues at the table.  I had quotes from Betty <unk>
The Gloria <unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," which I <unk>
And so I took this breath and I went down the look and my backs and the next four years with a little four years with a little little girl, which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a little girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
And so I took a little bit back, again, I got from <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is kind of confusing.
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and I saw a girl, and you know, I'm a girl, and you know, you like to use a pink, and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more than a <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas. It's <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- you just go, "Oh, well, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the hard conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I have lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color are the walls.
You just know how one feels like being living in a closet.
So this is how my lesson is not unlike you or yours or yours.
<unk> I'm going to give you 100 reasons why I get out of my closet was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> the difficult thing is not <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me to tell someone that you have declared on online banking is harder than telling it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder than to tell your three-year-old son you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, there is only the hard thing.
We must stop to classify what it's hard to do with what hard to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live a difficult thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make sense of security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made -- it is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, that had a horse, a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian ready to fight any four years of four years to get the coffee.
I was frozen in the fear, <unk> in a corner of my New York <unk> my <unk> <unk> and moving only a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my friends, full strangers who have spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was turned around to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all kept at so long, but if you didn't buy that <unk> to kill you.
One of my more memorable launches was my sister.
It was the first time that many of us guests knew that I was gay, and when I did my baby <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally got to one where my parents' friends were my parents, people who knew me was doing years old.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women volunteered to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Did you ever agree on the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite show, Will Grace
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but wait desperately to show her support, to make me know that I was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how hard hard conversations are still without being my strong point.
Ask anybody that I was <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I still like to call the three principles of the Girl Effect.
Now, please see this through the <unk> perspective, but you understand that what it is going to be out of any country is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl at the coffee didn't have protection, but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be direct -- just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents may maybe be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
You will never get rid of that.
And some of them can be hurt safe, <unk> so they've done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yes, maybe some will be <unk> but that stuff in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find yourself in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And it may feel very yourself, but they are not.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
What is that?
If you look at the history of what the intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of this is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be able to <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism on the pioneers of computing like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
So let's go back to a step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that you're from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, like <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that you don't know about this, which has no concept about intelligence on Earth, you would see how to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that we see on the surface of a planet, they stop doing it.
And that's why I claim that this is the same question as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of themes across the science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, towards a only underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be tuned down, adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for developing universal states that we need, the diversity of potential future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movements, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the robots of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all of these different themes and <unk> together, I asked the question, for several years ago: There's an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force, because it acts in the end of maximizing the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a force on T, with the diversity of potential disease. Yes, to an imminent time <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the choices open.
And so having on account this equation, is natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How about <unk>
<unk> the human intelligence level.
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have a tendency to conditions more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection to the entropy and the intelligence is a more inclusive relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but it actually comes out of it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system in which you find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could go through multiple animal intelligence, play games, and even make money from <unk> actions, all of that without the wrong thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to be able to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance has applications for <unk> robotics and human assistance.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, like some other animals can cooperate by pulling opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This ability to cooperation have interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we do successfully play a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> his potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where your friends are constantly moving and keeps the web the very connected net.
This same capacity for healthcare also has applications in healthcare, in energy and intelligence.
Here we look at <unk> organize the routes of a fleet of boats, finding out with success and using Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiating actions, increasing assets under their exponentially.
This risk ability will have tremendous applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of different cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term -- robot, <unk> there was always the concept that if we had smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, would be a <unk>
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had the whole concept of the rebellion in the other way.
It's not that machines first get smart, and then they get <unk> and you try to take care of the world.
It's all the opposite.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals and learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants of helping them build artificial artificial intelligence, or to help them understand human intelligence -- is this: The intelligence must be viewed as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the conquest of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've extended our understanding of our understanding of how it fits Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA NASA mission has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which is what the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the faint intensity faint from the stars when the planets go through the front of them, and they block a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data collected by Kepler by Kepler that shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there is between them and their stem star.
So together, this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their sake.
Instead, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we are finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds -- our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year was the hottest recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since millennia, now are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
And these environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, and I don't know.
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets about the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know -- the one of our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be a potentially habitable world, demonstrated that by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable at the past and partly because we studied both on Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that the <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now provide not only short space flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But despite the fact that all these <unk> images remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet who are still left by <unk> places with Mars.
Even in the <unk> and highest places on Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen in our forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets, to get a great and sad implication of the implications, and the belief and the belief that we have to find out there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that is truly livable Earth.
For a lot of that I like the exploration exploration, I am in deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars is going to be there for <unk> to humanity is like figuring out that the captain of Titanic will have a place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration and land preservation -- not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same way, the goal of understanding and preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They're just closer than home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of land, maybe we could meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with a <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked the question, when our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life to now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations get become advanced advanced advanced enough to consider to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we could do this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization, <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and space exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to identify the hostile environments on Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the easiest task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I took my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were on the dining table of the dining room, where there was <unk>
So quickly he tried to open all the other gates and windows, and they were all very well.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get it cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and <unk> from my passport and my bag.
They are expensive, but they don't more expensive than a <unk> at the middle night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, it will be very stuck.
I'm a profession a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rhythm, and <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I came to the counter counter at the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could be done, that I could put in your place, which would be able to put bad things.
Or at least if bad things happen, the likelihood that it is a total catastrophe for that.
So I got to think about that, but until a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about he broke the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called SARS.
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as the <unk>
Everybody knows what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts came and tries to figure out what came wrong, right?
On the <unk> like <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that might be out wrong, then tries to figure out what it can do to prevent things to happen, or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some of the things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
On the house, you know, a place for the things that are <unk>
This sounds common sense and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space <unk> works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the important things, where the same is, where the fish are, where the fish are looking at the <unk> trees where they live the female and <unk> tribe.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, cut the sense of the <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They didn't use smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not as good for things that are moving so much.
This is the reason for losing keys for your car and reading and <unk>
So at home, you know, a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For your passport, a <unk>
For your reading, a <unk> in particular.
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it that you will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take on the cell phone, a picture of your credit cards leave your head license, your head license, you know, mail to the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you are under stress, the brain releases you through.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of the hands-on practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation than when you cope with a medical decision.
And at some point, all of us will be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear to, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of it is made of medical decisions and in fact for the decision for financial decisions and social choices, any kind of decision that we need to take out of one rational assessment of facts.
So suppose they go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've gotten the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most popular drugs in the world today, even there are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you must do then, a statistic that you must ask for the most doctors don't want to talk about, and companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have a surgery on any medical procedure before you help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
Number one must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if not to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's someone, it's about scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk>
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of the drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which believe it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the cynical researchers and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now I'm probably going to be thinking, "Well, one chance for 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> right?
For this particular drug, the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.
And those include things like <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely that I get to me, even take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress they don't think clearly.
So think about how we do it with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, no? A person has taken five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to be able to go out of the drug for the drug that the drug can help you.
I don't say they had or not take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> government requires is part of the informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to initiate the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air because of the value of crash, but actually this number you need to deal with is quite typical.
To the surgery, which is more done in the oldest men in the age of 50 percent of cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
So it's 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can argue that we have the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it's got a lot of times, they want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that I could have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the time, but unless you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases it under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face with a <unk> you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You could get lunch to the lions, so none of that matter.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out in the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought of rational thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been shown.
So we have to think about the future of these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We are all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that help you minimize damage, or to prevent things bad in the first place.
<unk> the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key door to the same one, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of letters that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the score, you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound of <unk>
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little story.
The French sign language came during the 1960s and over time, and over time, it was mixed with local signs, and the language that we have now known as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world is like I lived in a foreign country, following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms and <unk>
So how do I understand sound about it?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I learned, for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise on the eating of potato chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, you didn't get the <unk> <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag more than the average person does.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound that's coming next.
So this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
It will go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do your thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk>
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited a museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has come into my realm of art.
I'm going to ask you more of art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that they don't just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was shocked with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power -- <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a single person <unk>
And sound is so powerful that I could be able to get it back to me and my artistic work, or I could tell you about it.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like it didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
That way I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, to ask <unk> your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan on a very high interest rate.
If I don't continue with this practice, I feel that I might be able to focus on the <unk> and not to have any kind of social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic medium in the music world.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note is not able to capture and express completely on paper.
And the same thing can be said in a <unk> concept.
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals like sounds.
I would like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better how <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide into a lot of different different <unk>
If you <unk> a different parameter for each finger while you're playing the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the form of hand, the way the piano, and the English is a linear language, like if you put it out and just a button at once.
However, <unk> is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers in a way in order to express a clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only a <unk> would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing with music in terms of <unk> <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters can be expressing different ideas.
For example, the <unk> sign in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I was <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and it would turn it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun, and it comes in.
This is all the day."
If you look at it, and you can pull it down, you know, the speed, you see a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to yourself, <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how distance into body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present two hands, the present is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic at the time, let's go back again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of <unk>
However, when I look at the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically I think, at the same time."
Look at your right hand, <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> across the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All with your hands on top.
Now we're going to do it both in my head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, pretty good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help all the cultures and the language of signs all over the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and thriving as the music.
However, today, we live in a very primitive world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it has no social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow them to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a society more <unk>
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learning <unk> and you have to hear to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich treasure.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents were saying, "Can you look at everything, but then you have to <unk>
freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination led me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a <unk> or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrible truth.
And when I got me older, I learned that adults also have a lot of good things to clean up the others.
Time passed, now I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention in the Hong Kong <unk>
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it wrong.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And over the last decades, we have been coming out with these large ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and we put it into this information on a map.
But it lasts into an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those enormous ingredients.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream about making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started to build this <unk> of work with <unk> so that the very good kids can actually participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to get them into something that we hope it works.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took an image of this <unk> the kids get a lot to the robots.
Then we started very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up with <unk>
And we turned out light and websites in accessories. And they would take it into a floating robot that gets slowly moving around the water and for the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor, while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
And we took this whole invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
And I investigate my problem with <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it was <unk> with this image.
A child, maybe 10 years old, cleaning a oil spill, only using the hands in <unk> the world's largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown, the mud and the oil is brown color, and when it all <unk> it's very difficult to see what is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what lies in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can spread across all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> what can help to identify what is in the water.
And we put this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or in analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help the remote other children.
I looked at a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe I could address a harder problem and also closer to me.
I'm half a Japanese and French half French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in Fukushima, a nuclear central nuclear <unk>
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west, we can measure <unk> radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast -- and the most part, it has a safe thing, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the crash and devote independently with other scientists, the land, the land, the river, and we wanted to bring the children.
Of course, not <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here, you see the use of different masks use.
It might seem that they didn't get the job seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Along with them discussed the <unk> data that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And with this we could notice that the radioactive dust <unk> from the top of the mountain toward the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this <unk> a civil expedition, the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a half miles of the nuclear core, and with the fishermen help from the area we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a <unk> tracking that we invented and build and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem: to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open and simple source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became so much small so much, we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turned it into the greatest space dedicated to social impact and environmental impact.
It's at the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with metal, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked ourselves, like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or, we can help the mobility of the aging age transforming their standard wheelchair into new autonomous vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists, creators, creators, we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two radically opposite cultures.
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel -- the other one silk thread is made.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
You put it over the environment, the other thought of it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said the angel said that when he looked at the raw, originally, he saw a figure that struggle to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we have all the information for every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have the consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and production in mass.
The lines of assembly have dictated a world in place, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects like <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> ancestors.
The skins of the back is <unk> with little <unk>
You look mostly like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, there's no <unk>
It's a system that goes gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the <unk> personality of every designer and an architect in working between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, and the organism, between the assembly and the growth between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis and synthesis -- it shows you two screens behind me.
My work, in its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, stepping out of the assembly and getting growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why wasn't it possible about it 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they connect four disciplines that offers access access to tools we had never had access to before.
And on the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools and tools at scale, like this robotic arm with a <unk> scope of the diameter of the diameter of a <unk> basis that someday is not very far to print <unk> buildings and graphics and graphics made from genetically altered genetically altered in the dark.
Here's <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the former Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every groove is unique to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it's like a second skin made of one piece, which is made of flexible <unk> around the waist.
We print 3D printing -- we print this layer and 3D 3D <unk> and you will show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> image.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments that allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair a chair at the time, comfortable and also that absorb sound.
The Carter professor came back to the nature of <unk> and when you design this <unk> surface pattern becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure of pressure on the human body.
Their surface, as in nature, it changes its functionality not through the addition of another material, or another <unk> but continuously <unk> and <unk> material property.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a Muslim Muslim home but when I was young, my grandmother told me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came out and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, then leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made trees grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world done in place.
I often ask myself, "What would design if the objects were made of a <unk>
Tell a better state of <unk>
So we would look for the material that we can put the kind of material in the tree of the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons are produced every year by organisms like shrimp, crabs <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could tune in your properties, we could make <unk> structures in one piece of this.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal.  We asked a lot of <unk> from <unk> the <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures in a system with multiple <unk> <unk>
The robot could change the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made out of a single material for a long material, 100 percent recyclable percent.
When the pieces are lists, you get it dry to find a natural form of contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process used to be used for <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed genetically to capture the atmosphere and make it sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems with <unk> and if it broadens even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp from a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part of the objects that are designed to be used to put them on the sea, and they were <unk> life and placed on the ground, they will grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of making clothing to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we made our own table of <unk> new forms of life created by <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological animals, into very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops.
In our first piece of clothing, you know, two links to it.
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and the ponds of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light into sugar, the other burning sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms, you don't interact in nature.
In fact, never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a clothing piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks at the <unk> tract that will help us save these bacteria and to <unk> their way.
And so we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they give more transparent.
This digestive system <unk> when you reach from one end to another, it is about 60 feet.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times the very big gut than our very <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are very much <unk> creatures, only half a <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the living matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin -- <unk> the damage and destroy our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is actually <unk>
It also knows that nature doesn't do it that way.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which it was <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> about this level of <unk>
It does it through combination not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts like a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, drop those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, it creates a tension, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces in life, they manifest in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm.
We put it into a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of dots in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
But when you place the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they would take a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of the different <unk> and we've discovered that form, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
They are often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk becomes <unk> and they used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can give silk <unk> without boiling <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms -- to more dark and <unk> and so we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
And so we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, distributing silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> silk worms to a online farm.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to meet us.
We put them carefully at the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> they give all this <unk> our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk> feet.
In a curious symmetry, this is the length of the silk route as well.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 orders in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full of empty arm.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings around us, to form a different ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new design of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by an inspired nature of an inspired nature of us, which demands for us, for the first time, that we get in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever asked you what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
They can <unk> with your toes.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some form of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who couldn't answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and the art of the website, I was playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having dedicated time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, it's not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I was struck by another thing, which is totally different, and I was interested in it, and I just let me absorb and I feel <unk> I have found <unk> and then again, this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it to it.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions, and we would teach them to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad at me is not <unk> at all.
I was concerned to be afraid of engagement, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story, and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I would like to have asked you then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
Let me tell you where the <unk> learned from the culture.
You ask us to first ask ourselves, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years old.
And the truth is that nobody cares about that age.
It's considered a naive question to create nice answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
So this question is about us and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asking them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before we get away the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by kids to dream about what might be, it's not inspired to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though well-intentioned adults are probably <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative voice.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of manifest or true <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to be doing during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and devote your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected in this way?
What happens if there are a lot of different themes that are tracking their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone to be in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so I say.
It could help if you divide into three parts: multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use any other terms that you can do the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of Renaissance the ideal was who was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
They would play any term you like or <unk> yourself or <unk>
It seems to me as a kind of <unk> to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or woe that you have to win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers are <unk>
One, synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests shared in cartography, visualization of data, mathematics and design, and they found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea of his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
So there comes the new ideas.
And <unk> with all their background can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower superpower is fast.
When we <unk> we become interested in it, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and go out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to each new area that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full time and an independent writer and an <unk>
As a young pianist. It was an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest most quick story.
Before she turned into the writer, <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the deepest sales mechanics when they were starting their thumb, and this ability helps to write a compelling launches for the editors.
It's rarely a loss of time to go to what you would give you even if at the end of the end.
It is possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower superpower is adaptability. It means the ability to transform anywhere else that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos -- other <unk> a website, sometimes consultant of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can relate to the market needs to be able to meet the market needs.
So <unk> <unk> learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if you're pushed to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> the belly knowing they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get out of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep down and put ideas into ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and careers that are connected to how we're connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them are told to be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said this, if there is one thing that you will take out of this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with your inner wiring -- whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist -- then let's go through all the media.
That's where you get the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have ever realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes, and I tell you, "I have a lot of passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring brings us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> he did a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
Even more shocking,
If <unk> had been alive today, we couldn't give it any more help than he was <unk> he gave him <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> the medicine has advanced a lot.
They've been discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> lots of treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's little progress on Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find an Alzheimer's cure for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include a lot of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of receiving Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the probability that they will go through their <unk> or helping to take care of a friend or be dear disease.
Just in America, Alzheimer's care about 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spending in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and costs by a <unk> increase in the year 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest and social challenges of our generation.
But it has done relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first top causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or cure their development.
We understand less Alzheimer's than other diseases because we have invested less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that in Alzheimer's cancer research, despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what few people know, but the entire world -- Alzheimer's disease is a disease, and we can get it <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, the scientists, it provoked Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a healthy brain, healthy compared to the <unk> patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to to trigger a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the harm of the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces the life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what would be block is complex, like a bomb.
You had a cable to do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, at the most of the cords have been reduced and waited for the cables that would be <unk>
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical <unk> engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. You now are testing a new kind of drugs that they blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move very normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that are attached to each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms -- in an early stage, then we see that they are <unk> and they live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to get that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We must tell ourselves that Alzheimer's disease is a disease and that if we do it, we can make it <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
The entire world with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I took this article in the New York Times column, in January of this year.
To love someone, do this.
And the article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to try it to test it at the last summer night.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are <unk> to make 36 more and more personal questions, and then both you look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number one: When was the last time you get to someone else's person?
And <unk>
<unk> that they <unk> these are increasingly personal ones.
Number one: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like about him or her -- I know very honest -- this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
And yet, we were <unk> and -- and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to the British column -- three months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably ask some of you guys -- they don't get out of it.
And the reason I think I think about this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the article was published was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been reminded to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few different views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends, and I thought my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousands of place.
And that came up with a relatively new burden on a relatively new relationship.
But how did I have no idea.
The article was posted on a Friday night and then on Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I already had called Improv Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was, for saying something, a little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing about <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that human life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or I had a book -- what they did every day for weeks, always they were doing the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> <unk>
And so many messages they came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers who are <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't ready for the breadth of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article by San <unk> which included the experiences of readers at the test of the study at the study of different degrees of success.
So, my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both made a public place together.
They were interviews, and television interviews, and <unk> orders for all of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked out, they wanted to know if the study worked out, they wanted to know if it was able to produce <unk> not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel to answer.
My relationship was just a few months ago, and I felt about everything, people asked the wrong question.
How do you know if they were going to get together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
So instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal approach, among college students, using what they <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were felt closer after doing doing that several further studies, they also used the inherent protocol -- they also used <unk> protocol and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between the police members and the community, and they have used it among people in the opposite of <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to tell you that you get rid of the person with whom you do it.
Well he <unk>
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But they got better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation for the first time.
I'd had that relationship since I had 20, which I was supposed to see my whole adult life, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I turned to science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized that at the time I thought I just applied to the book I was writing but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was fascinated with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I was then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in a different way.
I'm more <unk> I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what it is.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than reasonably much as far as I can demand me.
What I look for love is a <unk> not just about being <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but that will continue to be <unk> indefinitely for the person I love.
It may be that this would be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told you about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of it, and this is a very <unk> story, because in love with us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we are very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that asks, still still together?
And their content with a response of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's tell you more difficult questions, questions like, "How do you decide who your love deserves and who doesn't?
How do you stay in love when things get wrong, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty which inevitably leads to an relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what to love somebody.
So, if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, is <unk> a year ago, a known thing and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my journal <unk> <unk> didn't happen.
<unk> love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was no thought of what that choice was.
I didn't think at how many times we would have to make that decision, and how much times will it have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always chose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, to have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily <unk>
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what I would do, and what I might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little <unk> in full mountain, and I sort of came like a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a while ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and I took a dollar, a dollar, and a <unk> and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species, ideas, why do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from tour and make <unk> and all these <unk> things and I was doing a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and made a sort of <unk> <unk> for Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking, I could get it wrong.
Instead, it happened the opposite of it, in some way it seemed like it grew up, as if it was <unk> text with a <unk>
So I did that? I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> draw just like a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects out, and I created my own taxonomy of specimens by <unk>
First of all, let's think about the ones that you can have an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money out of money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
<unk> man.
At some point, I became interested in human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings within layers.
And it was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, and similar to the drawing on a window and then another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that form a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my <unk> work with something very big -- I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by a great deal in "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has a lot of <unk> so they are 10 meters old.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animal heads are moving between two worlds.
They are the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
Here is where creatures with animals are heading to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is on the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of rare things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But anyway, some kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out there.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> being the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's a look at the <unk>
It's a little bit of a story.
That is the hand in which he <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> 5.5 feet long, a snake tail that unites the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turn on fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened that.
Things that go up, you know.
His tail ends up in an eye balloon <unk> made out of <unk>
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards in the terrorists.
All right.   This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be considered dictionaries or magazines.
But each one would act as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups, four or 12 or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. It's bringing me years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of a human stuck inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, and the <unk> can be <unk>
I'm going to see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever.
It's a quick review of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There's a few pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue out there.
There's a little forest scene inside the chest <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician a musician -- a musician, a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people in it strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get older, who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we got to realize that we are all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion -- it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter of the same thing and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that a pill has effect against pain, first happens by stomach, your bowels and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug is going to make any effect on the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a great problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they have to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the tumor account.
But they are also known for their side effects, <unk> mostly negative, because in the time that it takes them to get to the blood line, they will get rid of them and worse for the time that it takes to get to their destination, which is where it's more important, at the <unk> of HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph winds, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't get easily in the <unk> of the patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
And yet, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells out there.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is an treatment of life run by the oral life.
One day, I felt and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, that open and closing holes, and almost immediately cells infected with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people are asked, "How do you <unk>
We sent a little bit of a lot and powerful laser beam on the cell cell while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug into a matter of microseconds.
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> technology -- but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, and it goes to the site of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the bone cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the <unk> dream of <unk> in our case, a laser.
Thank you.
Over the last decade, I've been studying the armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They <unk> what these groups do when they don't shoot 'n.
My goal is to understand better to these humanitarian agents and study ways to encourage the transition of violent participation to a confrontation not violent.
I do work work, in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all of all, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors and non-governmental
For example, the <unk> arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed between a state and an actor <unk>
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know so well the reasons why they get it, but nobody analyzes it, what do they do when they didn't exist.
The armed fight and the political struggle are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, Palestinian <unk> known by their suicide bombers known for their suicide bombers also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups make more than just fire.
It's multitasking multitasking now.
They would take a complex machine of communication stations, radio stations channels and strategies on social networking stations.
And here you have the printed magazine magazine and printed in <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising <unk> but through business -- for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
Markets are also doing something else: they create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run in professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't hurt security and protection.
The ascent of the Taliban in an Afghanistan was torn by the war, or even the beginning of <unk> ascent can be understood by the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a foreign price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a vacuum and a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the electoral victory of 2006 on Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill up gaps in the government, and they emerge from armed groups, political groups, engaging in violent struggle and government <unk>
And the more complex and more sophisticated and more sophisticated people are these organizations, we can less than a state of a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, they run all its <unk> collect the garbage, run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations and <unk> and the more weak the states are the states, like in the Middle East today, more and fill that gap in the Middle East.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more than military tools.
<unk> that government of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand the <unk> groups, we understand better what incentives to offer to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors are not <unk> military power can make some fights, but not giving peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that gap of security, to fill that <unk> government that allowed these groups to thrive at a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid.
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was interested in like a bad feminist.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then on interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the age of 20 years, I had some strange ideas about the <unk> these women -- <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> the sex as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see what women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using the <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a very taboo and nasty.
I told you, as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-worth and dare to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that <unk> woman who realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also so proud to be.
For me, certain claims, are equal to men.
They would have the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world like <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use and accessible to the contraceptives and the <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, with no need for <unk> or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have into account our other <unk>
We are not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and gender, social condition, skills and much more.
We need to have into account these differences, and how do we behave the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the work, I hear rap music -- all volume.
Although the letter degrades in women, and I was really deeply, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin -- yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your t-shirt <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get rid of the <unk>
Think about it.
Do you have poetry -- right?
I'm completely <unk> for my musical expectation.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is everything I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> but also killing insects, the <unk> collection and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion journals and good things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of his husband, is his election, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, they accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they were born.
It was a problem.
<unk> Feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the <unk> and gay workers and <unk> for white women, <unk> <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that is good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist
It also happens the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
So we have this trend of putting feminists into a <unk>
We hope that it turns out to perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself <unk> that <unk> before you try to put on there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid to be tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> because of the fear of what that <unk> means that <unk> is not to be able to fulfill the little <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist in the last years.
In the <unk> Music 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three meters tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star openly embracing Feminism and to know women and young men who have to be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started <unk> if they were <unk> it was or not a feminist.
It took their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still fighting for a lot, we want a lot of a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any wife, <unk> until there is nothing left.
We don't need to do that.
Evil feminism, or rather, an Feminism more inclusive.
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change affecting its profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse <unk>
But when the bad choices are playful that makes it harder for women to achieve equality, gender equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and brilliant, and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
And they get rid of the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program comes to the sex violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio tag when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than as much as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports where athletes are trying to their classmates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in your magazine, engaging in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't even have a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of those of us who are <unk> but we're going to be able to participate in this kind of projects, we can also provide ourselves to be even even more than us, to be able to overcome the barriers to the decision.
Because we are no longer <unk> <unk> without these efforts, without adopting these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power directors and cinema producers and music, and <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable durable change.
We can also be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do with courage -- well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to not be <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because I think -- my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids were excited when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't care about to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was interested in a stronger version of myself.
And I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and from the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it wasn't anything.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing, and I also found that if I was a bit brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and see that none of us is the nothing that the world tries to tell us that we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I make the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad passport, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can be a little bit courageous, when you get a little more <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having gone to <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, they will get over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things from this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this from more than over half a century -- but many of the children involved in the outbreak of <unk> had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the argument on autism and vaccines <unk> disqualified and marked by being a fraud <unk> by the British Medical Medical School.
You don't believe the majority of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in risk for autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the rise of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it is creating their entire professional life without seeing a single case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued stable just three or four children for each 10 thousand.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of funds like <unk> <unk> is routinely referred to autism as an epidemic, as if I could give the other child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not the vaccines, what is it?
If you ask the people in the Center for Disease Disease Disease Disease Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and a better detection of <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't dissipate a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his two-year-old son contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be asked, why were they so <unk>
Why were the autism cases so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than to do with the slow and transformative progress of science that with the sheer power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it's discovered, but that story turned to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with an infant psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital -- in <unk> <unk> he wrote an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds -- <unk> people around their own parents.
They could be fun for hours by waving their hands before their face, but they were prey to panic like when he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing it.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared it had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome while <unk> references to places like South Africa.
This is really not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
He was once <unk> that he had turned to nine of every 10 children sent to his office by being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of children in a form of child or cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have kept in a fridge that doesn't get rid of it.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that we put in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before it turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite record, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like children were simply <unk> what they heard their parents were desperate to make their approval on their approval of their approval ...
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the theory theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of <unk> mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband and his husband was warm and <unk> and they had a profound autistic child called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like black-eyed agencies, special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand up in the National Health Service, that they needed more resources to autistic children and their families, and their colleague Judith Gould and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
They launched an prevalence prevalence study in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or <unk> of <unk>
On the other way, these kids didn't fit on <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and they saw a lot of them, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would be models.
Initially, they were lost by trying to make sense of the data.
How did anyone ever realize these children before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article that was published in German in <unk> the next year to the article of <unk> and then <unk> buried under the <unk> of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article from competition, but I avoided <unk> on their own work.
There was no even an English translation -- but luckily, the husband of <unk> talked German and he <unk> it for her.
The document is an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school clinic in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, by described as a disability <unk> of life that we needed to support <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic like patients, Asperger's was called their little teachers, and they started to help the development of education to education that they were particularly suited to them.
Psychologists have seen autism like a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of ages and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits, the common and they have always been, looking at this continuum of this continuous archetypal events in the pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
And Judith and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> so the parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the diagnostic criteria that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes entered the <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a broad fudge <unk>
These changes didn't fell into a broken bag.
<unk> when I was <unk> and Judith worked at the <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before he came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four prizes of the <unk> <unk> psychologists, psychologists, and parents around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, the first clinical clinical evidence is introduced to diagnose autism.
It no longer had to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> the same as predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact expected that it went, how do we have the people with autism and their families finally understand support and services that are <unk>
And so Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines by the increase in the diagnostics. A simple, powerful, and <unk> history of credible history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one in 68 children in the ground are right on the spectrum, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
Over the last few years, people are joined on the Internet to reject the idea that puzzles are going to be allowed by the new doctors, the <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows work, it doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social engagement, and it suffers from a deficit disorder to detail.
<unk> people have a hard time to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most successful aspects of autism are in understanding of the teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
